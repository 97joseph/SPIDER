A few years ago we’ve started to discover the various investment options available on the Internet. We’ve tried numerous HYIP, revshare and other hybrid programs and always hoped they won’t shut down ahead of time. Unfortunately our experience was rather disappointing, the vast majority of these sites didn’t last too long and sooner or later closed down. In most cases they suffered from different kinds of financial trouble, there was even a case when the system was hit by a cyber attack and couldn't resume business afterwards. The most secure solution seemed to be diversification, splitting our capital into 10-15 different investment programs. This way we could mitigate the risk since we deployed only a portion of our money in each system instead of risking all at one place. That method worked for us! We’ve had enough of the unreliability and constant uncertainty! We wanted a stable, reliable source of income that gives the opportunity also to others to earn a healthy passive revenue without being concerned about their money. This was our mission in creating this website where your profit is generated from a diversified portfolio of at least 15 different investment programs. You don’t buy a pig in a poke. Our website is constantly updated to show you the current portfolio, all the programs that we use to eliminate your investment risks. Our goal is a solution that stands the test of time and provides you a stable, reliable one stop shop for your investment needs. This is the Sharks Holdings.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/sharksholdings.jpg?1578994068","tags":["Marketing, Ads, PR","Investments"],"latLong":"41.8780025,-93.097702","address":"3500 Iowa Ava apt 614 89123","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/groups/Sharksholding/","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/HILtfVYdRSz2ranU3-PStQ"}},{"name":"Changelly.com","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","dash","doge","xmr","xrp","etc","zec","alts","qtum","xlm","nem","zrx","grs","kmd"],"description":"\nChangelly is a popular cryptocurrency exchange providing the ability to instantly and seamlessly exchange over 100 altcoins at the best market rate or buy them using a bank card.\n\nOperating since 2015, Changelly has attracted over 2M registered users from around the world.

The main tools for online payment are bank cards, which are used to be called like “credit cards”. The most important position among them is taken by prepaid cards.\n\nSo, what is a prepaid card, and what is it used for?\n\nA prepaid credit card is a card, which has a certain amount by the time of purchase. It allows you to make purchases or pay for services on the same principle as a regular card, but a prepaid card cannot be recharged. Payments are made on behalf of the issuing bank, not by the cardholder. It allows to use some types of prepaid cards anonymously, particularly Ezzocard. This important point would be explained later on.\n\nVirtual credit card (VCC) is a complete analogue of the usual plastic credit card. It has exactly the same data set: a card number, an expiration date, a security code and a pin code. The main difference of a virtual card from the regular one is that the virtual one hasn’t a physical carrier and can’t be held in hands. At the same time, using a virtual card, you can also make purchases on the Internet and make payments via telephone.\n\nWhat is the advantage of virtual prepaid card comparing to regular? It could be purchased online at any time around a clock and get ready to use immediately, purchasing goods and services.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/ezzocard-com.jpg?1552723620","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Cloudnet Recovery","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nCloudnet Recovery is a consulting firm that specialises in the recovery of assets from financial fraud.Focusing on Binary Options, Crypto Currencies, CFD’S and Forex scams, we have collected the biggest data base by far on all of those scam brokers.The magnitude of this type of financial fraud...Show more...Cloudnet Recovery is a consulting firm that specialises in the recovery of assets from financial fraud.Focusing on Binary Options, Crypto Currencies, CFD’S and Forex scams, we have collected the biggest data base by far on all of those scam brokers.The magnitude of this type of financial fraud is bigger than most people know.

Any exchange transaction on the website is carried out in a fully automated mode, which guarantees that a client will instantly receive funds to an electronic wallet or a card.\n\nNetex24 is a multicurrency exchange service. We conduct exchange transactions with a wide range of electronic currencies. The exchange is an official partner of various international payment systems. At the time of writing, Netex24 conducts operations in 20+ directions of exchange!\n\nWe pay great attention to transactions of withdrawal of electronic currencies.

Such transactions are conducted in a fully automated mode, and our customers almost instantly get SMS notifications about money receipt to the card. We have our own, certified processing for receiving payments from bank cards! The processing complies with the PCI DSS bank card industry standard.\n\nOur professional team has extensive experience in cryptocurrencies. Netex24 processes hundreds of transactions with Bitcoins. For these purposes, we constantly develop and maintain the uninterrupted operation of our own Bitcoin server, which distinguishes us from most of the small exchange services that use third parties’ API. Netex24 enables our clients to withdraw cryptocoins to a bank card in a matter of seconds.\n\nBy supporting a large number of exchange transactions, we have to ensure an uninterrupted 24/7 service. For these purposes, Netex24 has rich functionality and powerful computing resources.

We claim that Netex24 offers some of the best conditions for most exchange transactions, and we offer the best exchange rate for the most popular transactions! Such savings can be achieved due to extensive experience in the exchange business and perfect software that performs various operations automatically.\n\nWe ensure excellent operation costs by automating our business processes. Trade robot Niagara, our proprietary development, automatically manages exchange transactions, analyzes competitors' rates every few seconds and presents the best exchange rates to customers. Small services that control their exchanges manually have no chances to compete with Netex24. Niagara is a serious competitive advantage of our service!\n\nDespite the best fees, we offer our regular clients to participate in the client program. Clients willing to register on our exchange get access to a cumulative discount. Discount allows our customers to change money even cheaper. We offer discounts up to 25% of the exchange service's profit on the exchange transaction. Discounts are applied automatically during the creation of an exchange transaction.\n\nIt is very important for the exchange service to provide professional support to clients. A powerful helpdesk system is deployed in Netex24 for these purposes. A unique ticket is created for each client’s request. All correspondence with the client is conducted within the ticket and cannot be lost or terminated until the client receives qualified assistance. Several specialists answer requests of our clients every day. This allows to process requests quickly enough, and Netex24 clients receive answers to questions or get problems solved within a few minutes in most cases.\n\nOur specialists process a large number of clients’ requests daily. Most of the correspondence with clients is conducted in a public mode. Any client can visit the support community at any time and see how things are humming, how clients are served, what problems can be observed at the moment. Only our service is open enough to gain the clients’ trust!\n\nWe care about the privacy of client data. Personal details, which clients enter at the stage of submitting the application, are securely encrypted by the SSL certificate.

Countless numbers of GPUs exist throughout the world in large Ethereum mining farms, corporate settings, government facilities, and more. A large number of GPUs can 51% attack smaller cryptocurrencies, leading to serious security issues.\n\nMoreover, most GPU mining pools automatically switch to the most profitable coin, which means miner incentives are not aligned with that of users. If a coin drops in value, miners simply switch to another coin. With ASICs, incentives are better aligned – miners cannot switch, which means they care more about the success of the coin.\n\nObelisk started as a project by the team behind Sia, a promising cryptocurrency project with a working product.

A few years ago we’ve started to discover the various investment options available on the Internet. We’ve tried numerous HYIP, revshare and other hybrid programs and always hoped they won’t shut down ahead of time. Unfortunately our experience was rather disappointing, the vast majority of these sites didn’t last too long and sooner or later closed down. In most cases they suffered from different kinds of financial trouble, there was even a case when the system was hit by a cyber attack and couldn't resume business afterwards. The most secure solution seemed to be diversification, splitting our capital into 10-15 different investment programs. This way we could mitigate the risk since we deployed only a portion of our money in each system instead of risking all at one place. That method worked for us! We’ve had enough of the unreliability and constant uncertainty! We wanted a stable, reliable source of income that gives the opportunity also to others to earn a healthy passive revenue without being concerned about their money. This was our mission in creating this website where your profit is generated from a diversified portfolio of at least 15 different investment programs. You don’t buy a pig in a poke. Our website is constantly updated to show you the current portfolio, all the programs that we use to eliminate your investment risks. Our goal is a solution that stands the test of time and provides you a stable, reliable one stop shop for your investment needs.

We have combined all the necessary elements like security, simplicity, and easy access so that the project meets your needs.\n\nQuick access\n\nWe reckon the cryptocurrency industry will replace the traditional understanding of money, that’s why our product was designed as a lightweight Bytecoin wallet, in order to allow everyone quick access to their funds without having additional infrastructure. The only thing you need is a device with internet access.\n\nSimplicity\n\nBytecoin Money wallet was made for those users who want to work with Bytecoin without syncing to the blockchain or installing additional applications. The functionality of our wallet is limited to necessary features, which allow you to send and receive transactions, manage your assets between addresses, and monitor rate movements.\n\nSecurity\n\nSecurity has always been the #1 priority for the Bytecoin Money developers, that’s why we have protected our project with various anti-hack features such as DDoS and brute-force protection, and have allowed our users to take advantage of multi-factor authentication, complicated passwords, as well as captcha.\n\nFAQ\nWhy use web wallet?\n\nBytecoin.money is a light alternative to Bytecoin Desktop available in any place with Internet connection. You only need to remember your username and password, like in any other website. No blockchain sync or installs necessary.\n\nIs Bytecoin.money secure?\n\nAbsolutely, as long as your credentials are safe and available only to you. For additional security, you can enable 2-factor authentication in your profile settings.\n\nSafety\n\nWhat if my password gets stolen?\n\nFrom a technical point of view, nothing would stop that person from logging in to your account. To prevent this, we support 2-factor authentication, which you can enable in profile settings.\n\nHow do I generate a secure password?\n\nUse a combination of at least 10 upper and lowercase letters, as well as numbers and possibly symbols. Avoid using passwords from other sites.

Visit our website (bitcoincashnotes.com) for more information and to see our notes in action here. Brought to you by Global Notes Pty Ltd.\n\nBITCOIN CASH NOTE DETAILS\n\n\n1. The note id\n\nThis is the production number of the note. All Bitcoin Cash Notes are produced sequentially and are marked as such.\n\n\n\n2. The version number\n\nThe version number provides the exact release of the note. All changes to the note are released with a new version number – please see our changelog for details of the version history. Each release has a note id range associated with it, which is the note ids that were printed as of the particular version.\n\n\n\n3. The face value\n\nThe face value specifies how much Bitcoin Cash is associated with the note and and its keys.\n\n\n\n4. The Bitcoin Cash address\n\nThe unique public address in Bitcoin Cash address format for the note. You may use any Bitcoin Cash blockchain explorer to validate that the address holds the amount specified with the face value of the note.\n\n\n\n5. The QR Code\n\nThe QR code displayed on the note is an alternative ‘matrix barcode’ representation of the unique Bitcoin Cash address printed on the note. Use the QR code to conveniently capture the Bitcoin Cash address for blockchain explorer validation.\n\n\n\n6. The private key & tamper-evident seal\n\nThis is where the private key for the note is sealed and where much of the note innovation and security is located. The private key is non-deterministic meaning it is unique, random and independently generated for the note. The private key is a string of random characters embedded underneath a tamper evident seal. Within the seal, the private key is further concealed with light impenetrable material. Any copies of the key made during the manufacture of the note e.g. for printing purposes, have been destroyed.\n\nAdvice for accessing the private key is below on this page.\n\n\n\n7. The tamper-evident seal code\n\nThe 4 digit code printed at the top left-hand corner of the tamper-evident seal provides enhanced security against covering a tampered seal with a new seal. The 4 digit code equals the last 4 digits of the Bitcoin Cash address.\n\n\n\n8. Fine-print\n\nOn the front of the note, around the edges of the border, a Bitcoin Cash icon is tessellated as chain mail. On the back of the note, the background orange color are the words Bitcoin Cash repeated many times. To see these features more clearly, please use a magnifying glass.\n\n\n\n9.

The Bitfi wallet costs $120 and requires no technical skills. Users don´t have to download or install any applications on their computer or hardware device. Instead, the BitFi device automatically adds all the latest updates and features by receiving updates directly from their node in real time. \nUnlike other conventional hardware wallets where private keys are stored on a device outside the computer, the Bitfi wallet calculates private keys using an algorithm every time the user types in their secret phrase. Once a transaction is approved, the private key is not stored anywhere. The private key does not exist on the device until you type in your secret phrase again. Therefore if a user´s device is stolen or seized, there is no way to gain access to the private key without the pin.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/bitfi.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/Bitfi6"}},{"name":"Red Leaf Chicago","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nRed Leaf Chicago is a Bitcoin ATM company based in Chicago, Illinois.

The main tools for online payment are bank cards, which are used to be called like “credit cards”. The most important position among them is taken by prepaid cards.\n\nSo, what is a prepaid card, and what is it used for?\n\nA prepaid credit card is a card, which has a certain amount by the time of purchase. It allows you to make purchases or pay for services on the same principle as a regular card, but a prepaid card cannot be recharged. Payments are made on behalf of the issuing bank, not by the cardholder. It allows to use some types of prepaid cards anonymously, particularly Ezzocard. This important point would be explained later on.\n\nVirtual credit card (VCC) is a complete analogue of the usual plastic credit card. It has exactly the same data set: a card number, an expiration date, a security code and a pin code. The main difference of a virtual card from the regular one is that the virtual one hasn’t a physical carrier and can’t be held in hands. At the same time, using a virtual card, you can also make purchases on the Internet and make payments via telephone.\n\nWhat is the advantage of virtual prepaid card comparing to regular? It could be purchased online at any time around a clock and get ready to use immediately, purchasing goods and services.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/ezzocard-com.jpg?1552723620","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Bitcoin Core Client","cryptocurrencies":["alts"],"description":"\nBitcoin Core is the full Bitcoin client and therefore takes up a lot of space as it downloads the full blockchain. \nAlthough the client is not rich in features, it does provide a high level of security as the private keys will be created and reside on your computer.\nBitcoin Core initial...Show more...Bitcoin Core is the full Bitcoin client and therefore takes up a lot of space as it downloads the full blockchain. \nAlthough the client is not rich in features, it does provide a high level of security as the private keys will be created and reside on your computer.\nBitcoin Core initial synchronization will take time and download a lot of data. \nThis is a semi-cold wallet and doesn't have any mobile capability to tap and pay on the go.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/bitcoin-core-client.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/bitcoincoreorg","github":"https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/issues","rss":"https://bitcoincore.org/en/rss.xml"}},{"name":"IMineBlocks","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","dash","doge","xmr","xrp","zec","eos","btg","erc20"],"description":"\nAdventures In Crypto & Blockchain Technology.\nVideos about cryptocoins, crypto mining and other technology that I find interesting.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/imineblocks.jpg?1564702794","tags":["Mining","News"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/IMineBlocks_com","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjYHcWGAjUVqU49D2JOKD3w/"}},{"name":"ViaBTC","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","ltc","dash","etc","zec"],"description":"\nViaBTC (Viabtc Technology Limited) was founded in May 2016 as an innovation-intensive startup dedicated to cryptocurrency.

Countless numbers of GPUs exist throughout the world in large Ethereum mining farms, corporate settings, government facilities, and more. A large number of GPUs can 51% attack smaller cryptocurrencies, leading to serious security issues.\n\nMoreover, most GPU mining pools automatically switch to the most profitable coin, which means miner incentives are not aligned with that of users. If a coin drops in value, miners simply switch to another coin. With ASICs, incentives are better aligned – miners cannot switch, which means they care more about the success of the coin.\n\nObelisk started as a project by the team behind Sia, a promising cryptocurrency project with a working product. Since then, we've assembled a team of dozens of skilled ASIC and electronics engineers with decades of experience, in addition to building out a dedicated Obelisk team.\n\nObelisk is building high-quality ASIC mining hardware for Decred and Siacoin.

Visit our website (bitcoincashnotes.com) for more information and to see our notes in action here. Brought to you by Global Notes Pty Ltd.\n\nBITCOIN CASH NOTE DETAILS\n\n\n1. The note id\n\nThis is the production number of the note. All Bitcoin Cash Notes are produced sequentially and are marked as such.\n\n\n\n2. The version number\n\nThe version number provides the exact release of the note. All changes to the note are released with a new version number – please see our changelog for details of the version history. Each release has a note id range associated with it, which is the note ids that were printed as of the particular version.\n\n\n\n3. The face value\n\nThe face value specifies how much Bitcoin Cash is associated with the note and and its keys.\n\n\n\n4. The Bitcoin Cash address\n\nThe unique public address in Bitcoin Cash address format for the note. You may use any Bitcoin Cash blockchain explorer to validate that the address holds the amount specified with the face value of the note.\n\n\n\n5. The QR Code\n\nThe QR code displayed on the note is an alternative ‘matrix barcode’ representation of the unique Bitcoin Cash address printed on the note. Use the QR code to conveniently capture the Bitcoin Cash address for blockchain explorer validation.\n\n\n\n6. The private key & tamper-evident seal\n\nThis is where the private key for the note is sealed and where much of the note innovation and security is located. The private key is non-deterministic meaning it is unique, random and independently generated for the note. The private key is a string of random characters embedded underneath a tamper evident seal. Within the seal, the private key is further concealed with light impenetrable material. Any copies of the key made during the manufacture of the note e.g. for printing purposes, have been destroyed.\n\nAdvice for accessing the private key is below on this page.\n\n\n\n7. The tamper-evident seal code\n\nThe 4 digit code printed at the top left-hand corner of the tamper-evident seal provides enhanced security against covering a tampered seal with a new seal. The 4 digit code equals the last 4 digits of the Bitcoin Cash address.\n\n\n\n8. Fine-print\n\nOn the front of the note, around the edges of the border, a Bitcoin Cash icon is tessellated as chain mail. On the back of the note, the background orange color are the words Bitcoin Cash repeated many times. To see these features more clearly, please use a magnifying glass.\n\n\n\n9.

It features a secure infrastructure, employing security techniques such as two-factor authentication, login guard, and cold storage, turning your trading platform into a secure vault.\nJubiter boasts an easy-to-use UI, allowing users to easily view, manage, and store their coins. It is a light and nimble wallet that is not laden with unnecessary and overcomplicated features. Essential features, including live rates, a straightforward converter, and an extremely convenient buying and selling platform make crypto trading a lot less threatening and Jubiter an attractive wallet for both experienced traders and first-timers.\nFor minimal costs, this wallet allows you to buy, sell and exchange cryptocurrency quickly (transactions are verified in a matter of seconds), easily and securely. Jubiter enables users to buy crypto via credit card, and to sell via bank transfer. Users are also free to exchange Bitcoin for Litecoin and vice versa. Soon to come is a debit card that will make users’ coins readily available for daily purchases or to withdraw cash from ATM’s.\nAnother feature this wallet offers is exceptional, round-the-clock customer support. This feature is too often lacking from other wallets that tend to assume users never come across technical problems. What can turn into an extremely frustrating and discouraging problem with other wallets is directly addressed and efficiently resolved with Jubiter’s customer support that is offered by phone, email or live chat.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/jubiter.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Coinucopia ATM","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nOne way Lamassu Bitcoin ATM inside the Westfield Valley Field Mall.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/5000/coinucopia-atm.jpg?1558035539","tags":[],"latLong":"37.323159,-121.968192","address":"2855 Stevens Creek Blvd, San Jose, CA 95128, US","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/lamassubtc","twitter":"https://twitter.com/LamassuBTC"}},{"name":"Green Address","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nGreenAddress is a multi-signature wallet that is very user friendly and has extremely good security. Private Keys are never held by the third party server side.  Payments have to be approved by Green Address itself.

The wallet runs on top of a full node so, be patient, it will take a while for the blockchain to be downloaded on your PC. As of 22nd of January 2016 the blockchain is 2.5 GB in size, depending on your internet connection speed it can take anywhere between a 20 min and a few days.\nThe wallet allows you to do more than just sending and receiving money. There is a whole section in there you can deploy contracts, manage contracts and interact with them. As well as add token contracts, which follow the standard token API.\n\nThe simple wallet works like a normal account with extra features being added at present. It has a really nice GUI and for most people, it will be a lot easier to use than the daunting command line interface.\nThe multisig wallet allows you to add a number of owner accounts and set daily limits. If the amount of money being sent is above the daily limit the multisig feature kicks in requiring multiple signers to release the funds. \n \n\nYou can find the latest wallet release on the Ethereum Mist Releases Github page.\nThis wallet is still in its early stage of development so caution is advised.\nOnce your full not is in sync, the Ethereum Wallet DApp will find all the accounts that you created on your PC and load them into the interface (the default keystore/account path, on a PC running windows 10 is: C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ethereum\\keystore). You will still need your password to transfer funds, but the whole process is a lot simpler with the GUI.\nThere is also a contract interface within the wallet. So, relax, wait for the full sync and be prepared to experience a glimpse into the world of tomorrow.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/ethereum-mist-wallet-app.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/feindura"}},{"name":"CoinOutlet ATM","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nFor the past year, CoinOutlet has been working towards the goal of an easy to use, easy to configure, easy to afford, and easy to own crypto coin ATM.

As users are paid out in mixed WAVES from the pool, the received tokens have no connection to the users’ original addresses.\n\nHow It Works:\nUsers receive a newly generated address from Tumblex. The Waves to be anonymized will be sent to that address. Tumblex in turn sends Waves from its own pool to one or more addresses specified the user for a small fee.\n\nIt's not about hiding anything but protecting your privacy. Like most blockchains, Waves Platform is an open blockchain and provides transparency. At the same time, this means that practically anyone can track anyone's transactions and see how many Waves users own.\n\nWhat is a Letter of Guarantee?\nA Letter of Guarantee is created for each participation. This is a letter digitally signed with our RSA key which guarantees that Waves tokens which were sent to our pool by the user will be paid out to the given output addresses. Small amounts of Waves can be mixed for testing purposes to ease user's worries.\n\nHow long does it take?\nAlthough we generally recommend our users to specify a delay for each transaction, it is not necessary to do so. Waves will be paid out as soon as they have been confirmed by the blockchain. The amount of required confirmations depends on the amount of incoming Waves.\n\nDo you charge any fees?\nWe charge a 0.5-3% fee which is set by the user and a 0.001 Waves transaction fee per output address.\n\nCan I send Waves twice to the same input address?\nNo! Please do not perform more than one transaction to the given address. Users can simply create another participation to mix more Waves. Waves that have been sent to the address after the first transaction cannot be refunded.\n\nWhat happens if I send more or less than the required amount of Waves?\nIn that case, our service would not process the transaction. You would have to contact us (Transaction data and Letter of Guarantee required) to resolve the problem.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/tumblex-net.jpg?1557959219","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/tumblexnet"}},{"name":"Cryptominingstore","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","dash","doge","etc","dgb","btg","qtum","bnb","kmd"],"description":"\nAt Cryptominingstore we offer mining hardware which are optimized for mining with graphics cards\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/cryptominingstore.jpg?1570174762","tags":[],"latLong":"52.0285323,5.6175662","address":"Maxwellstraat 27, 6716BX Ede, The Netherlands","socials":{},"paymentGateways":["CoinPayments"],"fiatPaymentModes":["CreditCard","SOFORT","GiroPay"]},{"name":"Centraltradehub","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xrp","ltc","bch","eos","xmr","dash","etc","doge"],"description":"\nWe provide the best forex and CFDs trading\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/centraltradehub.jpg?1563732311","tags":[],"latLong":"-32.781088,117.777695","address":"Homelands","socials":{}},{"name":"Zeriontrade","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","doge","xrp","bsv"],"description":"\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and worldwide payment system.

The wallet runs on top of a full node so, be patient, it will take a while for the blockchain to be downloaded on your PC. As of 22nd of January 2016 the blockchain is 2.5 GB in size, depending on your internet connection speed it can take anywhere between a 20 min and a few days.\nThe wallet allows you to do more than just sending and receiving money. There is a whole section in there you can deploy contracts, manage contracts and interact with them. As well as add token contracts, which follow the standard token API.\n\nThe simple wallet works like a normal account with extra features being added at present. It has a really nice GUI and for most people, it will be a lot easier to use than the daunting command line interface.\nThe multisig wallet allows you to add a number of owner accounts and set daily limits. If the amount of money being sent is above the daily limit the multisig feature kicks in requiring multiple signers to release the funds. \n \n\nYou can find the latest wallet release on the Ethereum Mist Releases Github page.\nThis wallet is still in its early stage of development so caution is advised.\nOnce your full not is in sync, the Ethereum Wallet DApp will find all the accounts that you created on your PC and load them into the interface (the default keystore/account path, on a PC running windows 10 is: C:\\Users\\&lt;username&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Ethereum\\keystore). You will still need your password to transfer funds, but the whole process is a lot simpler with the GUI.\nThere is also a contract interface within the wallet. So, relax, wait for the full sync and be prepared to experience a glimpse into the world of tomorrow.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/ethereum-mist-wallet-app.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/feindura"}},{"name":"Exarpy Wallet","cryptocurrencies":["xrp"],"description":"\nThe Exarpy wallet is a Ripple (XRP) web wallet that allows users to interact directly with the Ripple network through a user-friendly application.

Once the coins are sent to us, it is jumbled along with a series of other transactions through our mixer which has a reserve of over 2000 coins. Combining this with the countless transactions we have handled in the past makes it virtually impossible to pinpoint the source and endpoint of the coins. Due to the size of our reserve, we are also able to process transactions almost immediately leaving you with no concern of timely delivery of the coin.\n\nWe mark your bitcoins\nA few users often display concern of the fact that we could be sending the coins you send us back, with a fee cut on it. However, this is never the case. We mark the coins sent to us algorithmically and ensure coins sent by one user are never sent back to the same person. We understand the implications behind doing so and shy away from engaging in any activity that puts our users at risk. Liberty, freedom, privacy - we find ourselves to be guardians of the same.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/cryptomixer-io.jpg?1543096507","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Blender.io","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nBitcoin Mixing, Bitcoin Tumbling \nAre you looking for bitcoin mixing or bitcoin tumbling service?

As users are paid out in mixed WAVES from the pool, the received tokens have no connection to the users’ original addresses.\n\nHow It Works:\nUsers receive a newly generated address from Tumblex. The Waves to be anonymized will be sent to that address. Tumblex in turn sends Waves from its own pool to one or more addresses specified the user for a small fee.\n\nIt's not about hiding anything but protecting your privacy. Like most blockchains, Waves Platform is an open blockchain and provides transparency. At the same time, this means that practically anyone can track anyone's transactions and see how many Waves users own.\n\nWhat is a Letter of Guarantee?\nA Letter of Guarantee is created for each participation. This is a letter digitally signed with our RSA key which guarantees that Waves tokens which were sent to our pool by the user will be paid out to the given output addresses. Small amounts of Waves can be mixed for testing purposes to ease user's worries.\n\nHow long does it take?\nAlthough we generally recommend our users to specify a delay for each transaction, it is not necessary to do so. Waves will be paid out as soon as they have been confirmed by the blockchain. The amount of required confirmations depends on the amount of incoming Waves.\n\nDo you charge any fees?\nWe charge a 0.5-3% fee which is set by the user and a 0.001 Waves transaction fee per output address.\n\nCan I send Waves twice to the same input address?\nNo! Please do not perform more than one transaction to the given address. Users can simply create another participation to mix more Waves. Waves that have been sent to the address after the first transaction cannot be refunded.\n\nWhat happens if I send more or less than the required amount of Waves?\nIn that case, our service would not process the transaction. You would have to contact us (Transaction data and Letter of Guarantee required) to resolve the problem.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/tumblex-net.jpg?1557959219","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/tumblexnet"}},{"name":"Helix Grams mixer Tor service.","cryptocurrencies":["btc","bch"],"description":"\nHelix light bitcoin mixer by Grams is a bitcoin cleaning service that takes your bitcoins and gives you completely new, clean bitcoins that have never been used before.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/grams-bitcoin-mixer-tor-service.jpg?1584443172","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Centraltradehub","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xrp","ltc","bch","eos","xmr","dash","etc","doge"],"description":"\nWe provide the best forex and CFDs trading\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/centraltradehub.jpg?1563732311","tags":[],"latLong":"-32.781088,117.777695","address":"Homelands","socials":{}},{"name":"Alan Masters Trades","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","dash","doge","xrp","xmr","etc","zec","trx","eos","dgb","btg","qtum","bnb","usdt","bsv","waves","kmd","smart","bcn","grs","steem","pot","xvg"],"description":"\nAlan Masters Trades is a website that offers educational content related to trading cryptocurrency, technical analysis of charts, Bitcoin, Altcoins and everything related to the cryptocurrency markets.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/alan-masters-trades.jpg?1565620939","tags":["Trading","Edu"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"telegram":"https://t.me/@AMTrades"},"paymentGateways":["CoinPayments"]},{"name":"Growfund","cryptocurrencies":["btc","ltc"],"description":"\nWe have provide advertising program\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/growfund.jpg?1564747805","tags":["Ads","Trading"],"latLong":"14.48665,120.89846","address":"Bacoor cavite philipines","socials":{}},{"name":"Luxe Equity","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","erc20"],"description":"\nLUXE EQUITY ICO POOL venture is a private establishment saddled with the responsibilities of collecting investors funds, pooled together with the sole intention of investing in a reliable and profitable ICO.\nLUXE EQUITY ICO POOL is typically overseen by a group of individuals who managed the...Show more...LUXE EQUITY ICO POOL venture is a private establishment saddled with the responsibilities of collecting investors funds, pooled together with the sole intention of investing in a reliable and profitable ICO.\nLUXE EQUITY ICO POOL is typically overseen by a group of individuals who managed the contributions made by each investor and upon the participation of an investor in LUXE EQUITY ICO POOL, investors are typically given access to the pool’s research, and as well giving them the opportunity to access the quality of any ICOs for themselves.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/luxe-equity.jpg?1571992483","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"telegram":"https://t.me/ZerO00TwO22","medium":"http://nebo_1313"}},{"name":"Xitheon","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nInstantly start up a virtual private server, vpn or hosting plan on windows & linux based operating systems in the country of your choice with a bitcoin payment.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/xitheon.jpg?1582201342","tags":["Hosting","Different"],"latLong":"40.7127753,-74.0059728","address":"New York","socials":{}},{"name":"Dr.Signal","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","dash","doge","xmr","etc","trx","usdt"],"description":"\nProvide Best Daily Cryptocurrency Trading signal\nWe Are Expert\nEnjoy Trading With Us\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/dr-signal.jpg?1583156781","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"LiteVault","cryptocurrencies":["ltc"],"description":"\nLiteVault is an easy-to-use web wallet for Litecoin.

As architects and designers we are fortunate to experience the overall process, from the first conceptual phase to the completion of high quality projects. 3D and parametric modelling tools are at the centre of our design process, and we use them to quickly develop many design concepts to evaluate using simulation and testing software. Many of our projects involve complex geometry that is developed through bespoke-written algorithmic definitions and parametric scripts. A thorough process of experimentation with geometry, material choices, space layout, innovative building practices, contemporary theory, blockchain technology and big data is conducted once a project direction has been established.\n\nOur practice has adopted BIM (Building Modelling Information) technology since its inception, embracing the benefits of early design integration, coordination and collaboration with all members of the project team. Collaboration with clients, consultants and suppliers is central to our working methodology and allows us to work at various scales, in several sectors, and with different disciplines. Early 3D design and validation is used to assist coordination and facilitate clash detection – identifying critical interface issues before construction, and minimising the risks associated with redesign and over-estimating cost.\n\nAt TMD STUDIO, BIM is a process, not just a model. From the earliest sketches, through to simulation and specifications, onto construction drawings and facility management, all parts of our integrated and collaborative design process is part of a cohesive workflow that brings together the best possible minds to solve complex problems. BIM makes coordination part of an integrated and collaborative design process that reduces clashes and prevents significant re-working.\n\nTMD STUDIO’s BIM data provides a common platform on which designers and cost consultants work together to deliver project value. Merging cost data with continuously updated geometry in the BIM environment produces accurate cost models that give clients cost certainty.\n\nFrom the earliest stages of our projects, TMD STUDIO uses climatic and contextual data to inform sustainable designs. We use BIM to evaluate design options and simulate building performance.\n\nTMD STUDIO sets out to explore the extreme frontiers of domesticity in the age of network culture with the vision to create a decentralized architecture office and open industry platform.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/tmd-studio-ltd.jpg?1555318617","tags":["Design","Different","Home and garden","Consulting","Real estate"],"latLong":"51.497809,-0.084585","address":"30a Wilds Rents, London, SE1 4BP","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/studioTMD/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/studiotmd","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/studiotmd/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/studiotmd/","telegram":"https://t.me/ondrejchudy","pinterest":"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/studiotmd/","medium":"https://medium.com/studiotmd","rss":"https://www.tmd.studio/blog?format=rss"},"paymentGateways":["CoinGate"],"fiatPaymentModes":["Bank transfer"]},{"name":"MSigna Wallet","cryptocurrencies":["btc","ltc"],"description":"\nmSIGNA is an advanced yet easy-to-use wallet featuring speed and simplicity, enterprise-level scalability, and strong security.\nIt supports BIP32, multisignature transactions, offline storage, multidevice synchronization, and encrypted electronic and paper backups.\nA good compromise in terms...Show more...mSIGNA is an advanced yet easy-to-use wallet featuring speed and simplicity, enterprise-level scalability, and strong security.\nIt supports BIP32, multisignature transactions, offline storage, multidevice synchronization, and encrypted electronic and paper backups.\nA good compromise in terms of advanced features and simplicity. \n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/msigna-wallet.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Antiersolutions","cryptocurrencies":["btc","bch"],"description":"\nAntier Solutions is a leading exchange development company that offers world-class features in its crypto exchange development services to foster business growth while reducing the go-to-market time.\nOnce you have finalized every detail, the next important thing to consider is how to set up a...Show more...Antier Solutions is a leading exchange development company that offers world-class features in its crypto exchange development services to foster business growth while reducing the go-to-market time.\nOnce you have finalized every detail, the next important thing to consider is how to set up a cryptocurrency exchange platform?

The curated list of initial coin offerings, both ongoing and upcoming, tells you all you need to know about the winning projects in front of us. In 2018, we dig deep and try to learn all the tech details on investment opportunities in this space.\n\nLet's make it clear, this tech is hard. That's why you need to talk to developers, instead of reading clingy marketing stuff. That's the right way to weed out the bad guys. And we always try to do that!\n\nThere's no scams or \"might-be-scams\" in the ICO listings we deliver.\n\nRead on to learn about how you can win from the best ICO investment opportunities.\n\nWhat's an ICO in a nutshell?\n\nIt's a fundraising campaign. The organizers sell tokens and gets money in exchange. The tokens are cryptocurrencies that will be used at the platforms that teams want to build. They are used to transact within that platform, while you can easily withdraw into real money as well. Some projects have a specific use case, some are mishy-mashy (like a itty-bitty project called Ethereum). The tokens are limited in supply. This means that their prices will skyrocket, whenever real users come to these platforms, enabling investors to exist with huge profits.\n\nThe beauty of ICOs is that you can invest just a couple of bucks, but get a foot into the next Facebooks and Googles. Some of these companies will kill Facebooks of today. It's like what email did to snail mail.\n\nIs this all talk and no real action with you guys in this space?\n\nNo, there's a lot of ICOs that have already started to deliver servicers to the real world (Ethereum, Augur, Ripple). In 2-3 years, they are going to rev up and become a major player in any industry. In 10 years, they will be norm with 90% of companies working through blockchains. It's like email, the Internet or iPhones. It's that big. Or, maybe, it's like crushing stones on each other getting sparkly thingy in there.\n\nHow's your site better than all other lists?\n\nWe go into the weeds, trying to understand the ICO mechanics. We believe that if you don't get it, it sounds shady.\n\nWe try to get in touch with the development team, teasing nitty-gritty details behind the marketing glamor.\n\nWe write simple, driven and fun-to-read reviews, filled with passion and vigor. We literally do what we love here.\n\nI am still having questions!\n\nWell, it's understandable. That's pretty hard-core tech we are talking about. The upcoming 2018 ICOs will drive deep into the rock-hard tech. You're bound to have lots of questions about it. Just take a deep breath, pour a cup of tea and say what's on your mind. We always answer all queries in the e-mail for particular ICOs we've listed.\n\nWe really want to help!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/foundico.jpg?1","tags":["ICOs","ICO/IEO services"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://facebook.com/foundicoofficial/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/foundico","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/foundico_official/","telegram":"https://t.me/foundico_official","vk":"https://vk.com/foundico","medium":"https://medium.com/@Foundico","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2079050.0"}},{"name":"Developcoins","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","ltc","dash","etc","neo"],"description":"\nCreate your own crypto coin with the help of our experienced tech experts, by integrating cutting-edge technologies with bank-grade security, and enable you and your users to trade effectively.\n\nWith vast experience in blockchain technology, Developcoins has become a leading cryptocurrency...Show more...Create your own crypto coin with the help of our experienced tech experts, by integrating cutting-edge technologies with bank-grade security, and enable you and your users to trade effectively.\n\nWith vast experience in blockchain technology, Developcoins has become a leading cryptocurrency development company having the unmatchable reputation in providing independent Cryptocurrency development services for every business, from start-ups to entrepreneur, to create your own cryptocurrency.

They occupied a leadership position very quickly and they were distinguished in the field of lingerie. The LORD underwear range is a perfect combination of comfort and beautiful fit for every hour in the day with comfort and quality and a combination of classic and modern trends.\n\nquality award \n\nThe whole production is placed in the heart of Macedonia, in Katerini, in the privately-owned facilities of 10.000 sq.m. That’s the place where the Greek cotton yarn becomes fabric and afterwards underwear. The 30 years of experience in production are a guarantee for the best underwear ever made. Orders are made directly from the central warehouse so that every costumer can receive today what they ordered yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe male line innovates with the ultimate combination of strength and masculinity which combine the classic with the modern line. Finesse details on the LORD female underwear line create real masterpieces. Inspiration for the children’s line with mischievous and also innocent colours on hypoallergenic fabric with style gives away dreamy underwear for children and infants. Constant persistence for perfection combined with the production of LORD underwear which takes place in Greek territory is our effective response for the daily challenges of the market.\n\nAsk today to be informed in person for your complete support.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/lord-gr.jpg?1546885162","tags":["Clothing","Video Production"],"latLong":"39.267067,22.302411","address":"lord underwear, greece","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/lordunder","twitter":"https://www.twitter.com/lordunderwear","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/lordunder/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/user/wwwlordgr"},"paymentGateways":["CoinGate"]},{"name":"Bitcoin atm near me","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nWelcoming to Gary Indiana at Economy Package is your own new bitcoin ATM machine.

As architects and designers we are fortunate to experience the overall process, from the first conceptual phase to the completion of high quality projects. 3D and parametric modelling tools are at the centre of our design process, and we use them to quickly develop many design concepts to evaluate using simulation and testing software. Many of our projects involve complex geometry that is developed through bespoke-written algorithmic definitions and parametric scripts. A thorough process of experimentation with geometry, material choices, space layout, innovative building practices, contemporary theory, blockchain technology and big data is conducted once a project direction has been established.\n\nOur practice has adopted BIM (Building Modelling Information) technology since its inception, embracing the benefits of early design integration, coordination and collaboration with all members of the project team. Collaboration with clients, consultants and suppliers is central to our working methodology and allows us to work at various scales, in several sectors, and with different disciplines. Early 3D design and validation is used to assist coordination and facilitate clash detection – identifying critical interface issues before construction, and minimising the risks associated with redesign and over-estimating cost.\n\nAt TMD STUDIO, BIM is a process, not just a model. From the earliest sketches, through to simulation and specifications, onto construction drawings and facility management, all parts of our integrated and collaborative design process is part of a cohesive workflow that brings together the best possible minds to solve complex problems. BIM makes coordination part of an integrated and collaborative design process that reduces clashes and prevents significant re-working.\n\nTMD STUDIO’s BIM data provides a common platform on which designers and cost consultants work together to deliver project value. Merging cost data with continuously updated geometry in the BIM environment produces accurate cost models that give clients cost certainty.\n\nFrom the earliest stages of our projects, TMD STUDIO uses climatic and contextual data to inform sustainable designs. We use BIM to evaluate design options and simulate building performance.\n\nTMD STUDIO sets out to explore the extreme frontiers of domesticity in the age of network culture with the vision to create a decentralized architecture office and open industry platform.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/tmd-studio-ltd.jpg?1555318617","tags":["Design","Different","Home and garden","Consulting","Real estate"],"latLong":"51.497809,-0.084585","address":"30a Wilds Rents, London, SE1 4BP","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/studioTMD/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/studiotmd","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/studiotmd/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/studiotmd/","telegram":"https://t.me/ondrejchudy","pinterest":"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/studiotmd/","medium":"https://medium.com/studiotmd","rss":"https://www.tmd.studio/blog?format=rss"},"paymentGateways":["CoinGate"],"fiatPaymentModes":["Bank transfer"]},{"name":"What The Server","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch","dash","doge","xmr","zec","etc","dgb","qtum","btg","kmd"],"description":"\nDesign & Development\nWe offer both basic and advanced custom websites based on WordPress.

Building a new website to capitalise on your big idea, whether in-house or via freelancers, seemed to always take forever and be over budget or be subject to compromising what you actually wanted.\n\nIn running a successful marketing and coaching business, it was clear that the demand for websites that actually make money is extremely healthy.

It’s one thing to want to start a website, it’s quite another to actually make money from your website. Too often clients would spend thousands building the perfect site but then have zero sales and very few visitors. Along with trying to start a business or side-venture plus a full time career…. It’s no wonder there are so many failed dot coms around.\n\nSo, here at Digital Renovators we decided to do something about it.\n\nPut simply.\n\n– We buy websites and URL’s that no longer work (or never did!)\n\n– We Improve or create websites to become profitable\n\n– We sell cash-flow positive & profitable websites\n\nWe may not do “Award Winning” or “Thought Provoking” arty pieces… but we will do great looking, socially engaging and profitable websites.\n\nDigital Renovators, a Yorkshire based Website design firm specialising in the buying, selling and improving of websites.\n\nThinking it’s time to change your online presence?

The curated list of initial coin offerings, both ongoing and upcoming, tells you all you need to know about the winning projects in front of us. In 2018, we dig deep and try to learn all the tech details on investment opportunities in this space.\n\nLet's make it clear, this tech is hard. That's why you need to talk to developers, instead of reading clingy marketing stuff. That's the right way to weed out the bad guys. And we always try to do that!\n\nThere's no scams or \"might-be-scams\" in the ICO listings we deliver.\n\nRead on to learn about how you can win from the best ICO investment opportunities.\n\nWhat's an ICO in a nutshell?\n\nIt's a fundraising campaign. The organizers sell tokens and gets money in exchange. The tokens are cryptocurrencies that will be used at the platforms that teams want to build. They are used to transact within that platform, while you can easily withdraw into real money as well. Some projects have a specific use case, some are mishy-mashy (like a itty-bitty project called Ethereum). The tokens are limited in supply. This means that their prices will skyrocket, whenever real users come to these platforms, enabling investors to exist with huge profits.\n\nThe beauty of ICOs is that you can invest just a couple of bucks, but get a foot into the next Facebooks and Googles. Some of these companies will kill Facebooks of today. It's like what email did to snail mail.\n\nIs this all talk and no real action with you guys in this space?\n\nNo, there's a lot of ICOs that have already started to deliver servicers to the real world (Ethereum, Augur, Ripple). In 2-3 years, they are going to rev up and become a major player in any industry. In 10 years, they will be norm with 90% of companies working through blockchains. It's like email, the Internet or iPhones. It's that big. Or, maybe, it's like crushing stones on each other getting sparkly thingy in there.\n\nHow's your site better than all other lists?\n\nWe go into the weeds, trying to understand the ICO mechanics. We believe that if you don't get it, it sounds shady.\n\nWe try to get in touch with the development team, teasing nitty-gritty details behind the marketing glamor.\n\nWe write simple, driven and fun-to-read reviews, filled with passion and vigor. We literally do what we love here.\n\nI am still having questions!\n\nWell, it's understandable. That's pretty hard-core tech we are talking about. The upcoming 2018 ICOs will drive deep into the rock-hard tech. You're bound to have lots of questions about it. Just take a deep breath, pour a cup of tea and say what's on your mind. We always answer all queries in the e-mail for particular ICOs we've listed.\n\nWe really want to help!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/foundico.jpg?1","tags":["ICOs","ICO/IEO services"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://facebook.com/foundicoofficial/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/foundico","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/foundico_official/","telegram":"https://t.me/foundico_official","vk":"https://vk.com/foundico","medium":"https://medium.com/@Foundico","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2079050.0"}},{"name":"DarazHost","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nDarazHost has been providing quality Web Hosting services since 2014.

In 1993, LORD underwear were awarded with the European quality award and in 2005 the company was certified according to ISO 9001:2000. They occupied a leadership position very quickly and they were distinguished in the field of lingerie. The LORD underwear range is a perfect combination of comfort and beautiful fit for every hour in the day with comfort and quality and a combination of classic and modern trends.\n\nquality award \n\nThe whole production is placed in the heart of Macedonia, in Katerini, in the privately-owned facilities of 10.000 sq.m. That’s the place where the Greek cotton yarn becomes fabric and afterwards underwear. The 30 years of experience in production are a guarantee for the best underwear ever made. Orders are made directly from the central warehouse so that every costumer can receive today what they ordered yesterday.\n\n\n\nThe male line innovates with the ultimate combination of strength and masculinity which combine the classic with the modern line. Finesse details on the LORD female underwear line create real masterpieces. Inspiration for the children’s line with mischievous and also innocent colours on hypoallergenic fabric with style gives away dreamy underwear for children and infants. Constant persistence for perfection combined with the production of LORD underwear which takes place in Greek territory is our effective response for the daily challenges of the market.\n\nAsk today to be informed in person for your complete support.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/lord-gr.jpg?1546885162","tags":["Clothing","Video Production"],"latLong":"39.267067,22.302411","address":"lord underwear, greece","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/lordunder","twitter":"https://www.twitter.com/lordunderwear","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/lordunder/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/user/wwwlordgr"},"paymentGateways":["CoinGate"]},{"name":"Mangools.com","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","ltc","bch"],"description":"\nProductive keyword research, SERP analysis, rank tracking and backlink analysis thanks to super easy to use tools.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/mangools-com.jpg?1566935775","tags":["Ads","Marketing, Ads, PR"],"latLong":"48.14739,17.110175","address":"Obchodná 507/2, 811 06 Bratislava, Slovakia","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/mangools/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/mangools_com","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/mangools_com/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/mangools"},"paymentGateways":["Coinbase"]},{"name":"PixelPlex","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xmr","zec","eos","qtum","usdt"],"description":"\nPixelPlex is an award-winning custom software development company with a proven track record, a mix of broad technology expertise, innovative business culture and over 100 talented developers.\n\nFounded in 2007, PixelPlex has delivered over 300 projects in Blockchain, AR/VR, Artificial...Show more...PixelPlex is an award-winning custom software development company with a proven track record, a mix of broad technology expertise, innovative business culture and over 100 talented developers.\n\nFounded in 2007, PixelPlex has delivered over 300 projects in Blockchain, AR/VR, Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Mobile, Game and Custom Software Development.

My name is Sergey and I am the founder of Creative Bear Tech, a lead generation, SEO and software company based in London, United Kingdom.\n\nSince starting up at the beginning of 2019, we have grown to over 7,000 clients comprised of startups, local businesses, wholesalers, blue chip companies and popular household brand names.\n\nPrior to starting up Creative Bear Tech, I was the owner of a famous vape shop chain, e-liquid and CBD brand and a crypotocurrency business. Initially, I hired numerous SEO and lead generation companies to help me but after spending in excess of six figures, they proved to be expensive and ineffective and used mostly outdated methods. That was my personal turning point when I decided to enter and forever transform the lead generation space.\n\nI made very substantial investments and opened up offices in the Baltic States and the UK and hired some amazing tech wizards. Creative Bear Tech was founded with the aim of adding value to businesses via cutting-edge methods and solutions that simply WORK and do not break the bank. Due to our modern business model, we achieve excellent economies of scale and pass on the savings to our clients. Unlike other companies, I have been in business for over 30 years now and understand the nuances and intricate requirements of running a business. This commercial awareness is in turn applied to everything that Creative Bear Tech does.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy doing boxing, dirt biking, exploring the hidden gems of London, constantly upgrading my gaming laptops, travelling and spending quality time with my family and friends. If you are ever in London, you are likely going to find me at Cinnamon cafe reading a paper and enjoying my favourite latte!\n\nI would love to see your business onboard. If you would like to connect with me personally, you can contact me via my mobile which you can find on our contact page. Whilst we have grown in size where I could hire a hundred virtual assistants, I strongly believe in a personal approach with every single one of our clients, and this is exactly what defines Creative Bear Tech!\n\nWe are the Leading B2B Lead Generation Company in London, UK Specialising in B2B Lead Generation Services\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/creativebeartech-com.jpg?1577005391","tags":["Ads","Marketing, Ads, PR","Software"],"latLong":"51.5101771,-0.0436857","address":"Flat 9, 1 Jardine Rd, St Katharine's & Wapping, London E1W 3WD, United Kingdom","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Creative-Bear-Tech-2284249764963533/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CreativeBearTec","skype":"skype:creativebeartech"},"paymentGateways":["CoinPayments"],"fiatPaymentModes":["PayPal","Stripe"]},{"name":"CreativeGray","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nCreativeGray is a US-based product design and development company.

It starts from the moment you contact our company, be it by phone, email or chat, and continues with easy order tracking, email notification of milestones, and getting your order done fast and with minimum effort on your end.\n\nSecond, hardly anyone in the industry can beat our prices, and our a-la-carte system of placing your order is a striking contrast to package-based offers of almost all other incorporators. In other words, while our competitors try to push you to buy things you don’t need, we make it easier for you to select precisely what you need - and nothing else.\n\nThird, our constant commitment for quality has earned us a whopping 9.88 out of 10 rating from ResellerRatings.com, with a five-star Elite Member status. In other words, our clients love us.\n\n\nSpecial Attention to International Customers\nFor most other U.S.-based online incorporators the focus is on the domestic U.S. market, while international customers are treated as a small side market.\n\nFor us foreign clients are as important as domestic, and our service was specifically designed to meet the specific needs of our international clients. As a result we enjoy from strong international customer base, and now we are proud to offer our services in languages other than English.\n\nFor our international clients we specialize in obtaining Apostille and Embassy certifications for use abroad. The website also contains detailed sections on setting up virtual mailing address and telephone number in the U.S. - especially helpful for running American online business from outside the U.S.\n\nFinally, we offer lot’s of free advice on such issues as banking and credit card processing for foreign clients, a topic of high interest and importance (unfortunately, also quite challenging, as you can learn from the article). Our special efforts are directed at helping our foreign clients properly handle the issues of U.S. taxation.\n\nIn other words, we make an enormous effort to help our international clients with all their U.S. registration needs.\n\n\nWe, at MyUSACorporation.com, are looking forward\nto helping you start your business!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/myusacorporation-com.jpg?1568651921","tags":["Legal, law","Consulting"],"latLong":"40.914393,-73.778212","address":"Radisson Plaza, New Rochelle, NY 10801, USA","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MyUSACorporation","twitter":"https://twitter.com/myusacorp","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1143836","pinterest":"https://pinterest.com/myusacorp/"}},{"name":"Bitcoinsuisse.ch","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth"],"description":"\nFounded in August 2013, Bitcoin Suisse is a pioneer and global market leader in crypto-financial services.

Building a new website to capitalise on your big idea, whether in-house or via freelancers, seemed to always take forever and be over budget or be subject to compromising what you actually wanted.\n\nIn running a successful marketing and coaching business, it was clear that the demand for websites that actually make money is extremely healthy. A growing number of clients are planning for a location-free future.\n\nSo whether they choose to travel the world or move to a new city, their business and income can continue unaffected.\n\nThe challenge is knowing where to start. It’s one thing to want to start a website, it’s quite another to actually make money from your website. Too often clients would spend thousands building the perfect site but then have zero sales and very few visitors. Along with trying to start a business or side-venture plus a full time career…. It’s no wonder there are so many failed dot coms around.\n\nSo, here at Digital Renovators we decided to do something about it.\n\nPut simply.\n\n– We buy websites and URL’s that no longer work (or never did!)\n\n– We Improve or create websites to become profitable\n\n– We sell cash-flow positive & profitable websites\n\nWe may not do “Award Winning” or “Thought Provoking” arty pieces… but we will do great looking, socially engaging and profitable websites.\n\nDigital Renovators, a Yorkshire based Website design firm specialising in the buying, selling and improving of websites.\n\nThinking it’s time to change your online presence?

My name is Sergey and I am the founder of Creative Bear Tech, a lead generation, SEO and software company based in London, United Kingdom.\n\nSince starting up at the beginning of 2019, we have grown to over 7,000 clients comprised of startups, local businesses, wholesalers, blue chip companies and popular household brand names.\n\nPrior to starting up Creative Bear Tech, I was the owner of a famous vape shop chain, e-liquid and CBD brand and a crypotocurrency business. Initially, I hired numerous SEO and lead generation companies to help me but after spending in excess of six figures, they proved to be expensive and ineffective and used mostly outdated methods. That was my personal turning point when I decided to enter and forever transform the lead generation space.\n\nI made very substantial investments and opened up offices in the Baltic States and the UK and hired some amazing tech wizards. Creative Bear Tech was founded with the aim of adding value to businesses via cutting-edge methods and solutions that simply WORK and do not break the bank. Due to our modern business model, we achieve excellent economies of scale and pass on the savings to our clients. Unlike other companies, I have been in business for over 30 years now and understand the nuances and intricate requirements of running a business. This commercial awareness is in turn applied to everything that Creative Bear Tech does.\n\nIn my spare time, I enjoy doing boxing, dirt biking, exploring the hidden gems of London, constantly upgrading my gaming laptops, travelling and spending quality time with my family and friends. If you are ever in London, you are likely going to find me at Cinnamon cafe reading a paper and enjoying my favourite latte!\n\nI would love to see your business onboard. If you would like to connect with me personally, you can contact me via my mobile which you can find on our contact page. Whilst we have grown in size where I could hire a hundred virtual assistants, I strongly believe in a personal approach with every single one of our clients, and this is exactly what defines Creative Bear Tech!\n\nWe are the Leading B2B Lead Generation Company in London, UK Specialising in B2B Lead Generation Services\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/creativebeartech-com.jpg?1577005391","tags":["Ads","Marketing, Ads, PR","Software"],"latLong":"51.5101771,-0.0436857","address":"Flat 9, 1 Jardine Rd, St Katharine's & Wapping, London E1W 3WD, United Kingdom","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/Creative-Bear-Tech-2284249764963533/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CreativeBearTec","skype":"skype:creativebeartech"},"paymentGateways":["CoinPayments"],"fiatPaymentModes":["PayPal","Stripe"]},{"name":"Cynere Infotech Private Limited","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nCynere is an ISO 9001:2008 certified company that has been into web and mobile development for last 8 years.

It starts from the moment you contact our company, be it by phone, email or chat, and continues with easy order tracking, email notification of milestones, and getting your order done fast and with minimum effort on your end.\n\nSecond, hardly anyone in the industry can beat our prices, and our a-la-carte system of placing your order is a striking contrast to package-based offers of almost all other incorporators.

In other words, our clients love us.\n\n\nSpecial Attention to International Customers\nFor most other U.S.-based online incorporators the focus is on the domestic U.S. market, while international customers are treated as a small side market.\n\nFor us foreign clients are as important as domestic, and our service was specifically designed to meet the specific needs of our international clients. As a result we enjoy from strong international customer base, and now we are proud to offer our services in languages other than English.\n\nFor our international clients we specialize in obtaining Apostille and Embassy certifications for use abroad. The website also contains detailed sections on setting up virtual mailing address and telephone number in the U.S. - especially helpful for running American online business from outside the U.S.\n\nFinally, we offer lot’s of free advice on such issues as banking and credit card processing for foreign clients, a topic of high interest and importance (unfortunately, also quite challenging, as you can learn from the article). Our special efforts are directed at helping our foreign clients properly handle the issues of U.S. taxation.\n\nIn other words, we make an enormous effort to help our international clients with all their U.S. registration needs.\n\n\nWe, at MyUSACorporation.com, are looking forward\nto helping you start your business!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/myusacorporation-com.jpg?1568651921","tags":["Legal, law","Consulting"],"latLong":"40.914393,-73.778212","address":"Radisson Plaza, New Rochelle, NY 10801, USA","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MyUSACorporation","twitter":"https://twitter.com/myusacorp","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/1143836","pinterest":"https://pinterest.com/myusacorp/"}},{"name":"Lobster Digital Marketing Limited","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nSince 2003, Lobster has been delivering quality online marketing services to our clients.

The new generation dreams of a free work schedule, many people even leave dusty cities and move to warm countries, working as a freelancer.\n\nToday it's trendy to dream of making money, sitting on the beach with a laptop or smartphone and closing successful deals at online trading platforms. But the nice dream is slowly turning to dust, when every day from the sea shore you look at the very yacht that you still cannot afford ...\n\n\nSo what's the trick?\n\nThe fact that you still keep \"earning\" Yes, everything is exactly the same as in the good old office, which you dreamed of getting rid of. Only the scenery has changed, but you need to change the approach.\n\nAfter all, to multiply finances does not mean to earn them, and the point is not in where we do it, but in what we are doing for it.\n\nAny successful businessman will confirm that in order to increase funds, it is enough to just earn a start-up capital, and then everything depends on financial intuition, proper investment and the ability to delegate, which makes 90% of success in the future.\n\nAll this is true, you say, but how can you invest money if your start-up capital is not a million, but just $10? And this is the main problem of most novice investors.\n\nThis is not the amount to buy Facebook or Microsoft shares, but if you don’t make this money work, you won’t notice how quickly it will be spent, and tomorrow you will start earning it again. This is a vicious circle, which BtcJob offers you to break.\n\n\nWho are we?\n\nWe are a team of experienced investors from three of the most successful countries of the world - Singapore, Russia and China. Over the past 5 years, we have successfully invested in real estate, IPO and cryptocurrency, and we know exactly how and where to invest in to receive stable high profit.\n\nToday, having accumulated enough experience, we invite brave and ambitious players to join our team. We are happy to take you into your ranks if you are smart, think outside the box and fully imagine what you want to achieve in life, moving confidently towards your goal. Yes, that is the portrait of a BtcJob partner.\n\nBtcJob is a platform where everyone can not only profitably invest their money even in small amounts, but also realize their full potential as an active business partner of the project.\n\nWell, forward to the new life?\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/btcjob.jpg?1563539389","tags":[],"latLong":"51.487138,0.063394","address":"55 Yateley Street Woolwich, London, United Kingdom, SE18 5TA","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/btcjobinvestments","telegram":"https://t.me/BtcJobChannel","vk":"https://vk.com/public184347381"}},{"name":"ICOplatform.tech","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth"],"description":"\nCoinfactory is the #1 ico platform in the market, battle-tested with more than ten ICOs already.

Instead, we provide the “picks and shovels” (ledger & wallet, exchange and KYC integrations, etc.) which allow businesses to quickly build their own software applications that support a range of new services or even new business models (often related to digital asset use-cases such as crypto-currencies, cash-back, loyalty etc.).\n\n\n\nWho are Omnigate Customers?\n\nWe target small to mid-sized businesses who want to “own” their software platforms and applications relating to digital assets but lack the developer resources to build viable platforms in-house (per below).\n\nWe sell either B2B (in cases where our customer has consumers as its customers, such as video game companies) or B2B2B (like payment processors, where our customers actually supply services to other businesses).\n\nIn some cases, our channel is to the developer, B2D.\n\nOmnigate offers support services for development, integration, and monitoring.

We also work with Personal and Life Coaching\n\nWHY HAVE A COACH?\nDo you consider yourself a happy and fulfilled person? Have you achieved and achieved all your financial goals? On a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rate your investments and personal finances? And how do you intend to be in 1, 5, 10 years from now?\n\nThese questions have passed - and still pass - in the minds of many people. It is natural for human beings to always strive for more, set higher goals and have a full and fulfilled life. However, it is not always easy to achieve all the goals and projects we set. This requires planning, commitment, the pursuit of opportunities and, above all, action, attitude in performing the TBC and leaving behind its goals.\n\nThe Coach is nothing more than a professional trained to assist individuals in taking the actions and attitudes necessary to achieve their goals and plans. Coach is a word that comes from English and means \"coach\". Its function is to contribute, through powerful techniques and questions, so that clients (also called Coachees) discover within themselves the answers they need to get everything they want within the shortest possible time.\n\nTHE COACHING PROCESS:\nCoaching is a goal-focused process with a well-defined beginning, middle and end. Within the process the Coach acts as a catalyst for Coachee's findings, utilizing high impact tools and questions. The goal of the coach is to generate the action itself, through powerful questions that will generate reflection, observations, questions and feedbacks.\n\nBEYOND COACHING:\nLynx also offers debt elimination, expense planning and investment advice.

The new generation dreams of a free work schedule, many people even leave dusty cities and move to warm countries, working as a freelancer.\n\nToday it's trendy to dream of making money, sitting on the beach with a laptop or smartphone and closing successful deals at online trading platforms. But the nice dream is slowly turning to dust, when every day from the sea shore you look at the very yacht that you still cannot afford ...\n\n\nSo what's the trick?\n\nThe fact that you still keep \"earning\" Yes, everything is exactly the same as in the good old office, which you dreamed of getting rid of. Only the scenery has changed, but you need to change the approach.\n\nAfter all, to multiply finances does not mean to earn them, and the point is not in where we do it, but in what we are doing for it.\n\nAny successful businessman will confirm that in order to increase funds, it is enough to just earn a start-up capital, and then everything depends on financial intuition, proper investment and the ability to delegate, which makes 90% of success in the future.\n\nAll this is true, you say, but how can you invest money if your start-up capital is not a million, but just $10? And this is the main problem of most novice investors.\n\nThis is not the amount to buy Facebook or Microsoft shares, but if you don’t make this money work, you won’t notice how quickly it will be spent, and tomorrow you will start earning it again. This is a vicious circle, which BtcJob offers you to break.\n\n\nWho are we?\n\nWe are a team of experienced investors from three of the most successful countries of the world - Singapore, Russia and China. Over the past 5 years, we have successfully invested in real estate, IPO and cryptocurrency, and we know exactly how and where to invest in to receive stable high profit.\n\nToday, having accumulated enough experience, we invite brave and ambitious players to join our team. We are happy to take you into your ranks if you are smart, think outside the box and fully imagine what you want to achieve in life, moving confidently towards your goal. Yes, that is the portrait of a BtcJob partner.\n\nBtcJob is a platform where everyone can not only profitably invest their money even in small amounts, but also realize their full potential as an active business partner of the project.\n\nWell, forward to the new life?\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/btcjob.jpg?1563539389","tags":[],"latLong":"51.487138,0.063394","address":"55 Yateley Street Woolwich, London, United Kingdom, SE18 5TA","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/btcjobinvestments","telegram":"https://t.me/BtcJobChannel","vk":"https://vk.com/public184347381"}},{"name":"spaz media","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nweb development and internet marketing specialists\nbased in toronto with a satellite office in rome\n\nwe build web media\nwe increase brand awareness\nwe strategically capture target audiences\nwe bring you further\n\nwe are a dedicated team doing work we love\nfor some 700 great clients since 2005\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/4000/spaz-media.jpg?1558029692","tags":[],"latLong":"43.708396,-79.36938","address":"5 Hanna Ave, Toronto, ON M6K 3E7, CA","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/spazmedia","twitter":"https://twitter.com/spazmedia"}},{"name":"Vega21.es","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nWith more than 20 years of experience, VEGA 21 has specialized in the design and manufacture of machines and technical solutions for the food, automotive and capital goods sectors.

A few years ago we’ve started to discover the various investment options available on the Internet. We’ve tried numerous HYIP, revshare and other hybrid programs and always hoped they won’t shut down ahead of time. Unfortunately our experience was rather disappointing, the vast majority of these sites didn’t last too long and sooner or later closed down. In most cases they suffered from different kinds of financial trouble, there was even a case when the system was hit by a cyber attack and couldn't resume business afterwards. The most secure solution seemed to be diversification, splitting our capital into 10-15 different investment programs. This way we could mitigate the risk since we deployed only a portion of our money in each system instead of risking all at one place. That method worked for us! We’ve had enough of the unreliability and constant uncertainty! We wanted a stable, reliable source of income that gives the opportunity also to others to earn a healthy passive revenue without being concerned about their money. This was our mission in creating this website where your profit is generated from a diversified portfolio of at least 15 different investment programs. You don’t buy a pig in a poke. Our website is constantly updated to show you the current portfolio, all the programs that we use to eliminate your investment risks. Our goal is a solution that stands the test of time and provides you a stable, reliable one stop shop for your investment needs.

With a rare eye for opportunity and over a billion dollars in investment and construction experience worldwide, we have the ability and expertise to design innovative and cost effective data centers. While other data center wholesale providers continue to wait for leases, Server Farm Realty continues to build. \n\nWe are changing the way customers lease wholesale data center space. We offer complete flexibility in lease options, from shell to server-ready leases and anything in between. This allows our customers to match their needs with their capital budgets. One of our most popular lease plans is the &quot;success based&quot; plan, which allows our customers to minimize capital expenses until they achieve the required revenue stream. \n\nServer Farm Realty works with our customers through the build process, giving them direct input in the data center design. This ensures that customer requirements are met and the cost is based on need—we build what you need as opposed to leasing you what we have.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/5000/server-farm-realty.jpg?1558036293","tags":[],"latLong":"33.91631,-118.40294","address":"999 S Sepulveda Blvd Ste 600, El Segundo, CA 90245, US","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Server-Farm-Realty-LLC/300387900087547","twitter":"https://twitter.com/SFR_DataCenters","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/server-farm-realty-inc."}},{"name":"Great Things Studios","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xrp","ltc"],"description":"\nGreat Things Studios is a dynamic Montreal video production company &amp; recording studio.

We also work with Personal and Life Coaching\n\nWHY HAVE A COACH?\nDo you consider yourself a happy and fulfilled person? Have you achieved and achieved all your financial goals? On a scale of 0 to 10, how would you rate your investments and personal finances? And how do you intend to be in 1, 5, 10 years from now?\n\nThese questions have passed - and still pass - in the minds of many people. It is natural for human beings to always strive for more, set higher goals and have a full and fulfilled life. However, it is not always easy to achieve all the goals and projects we set. This requires planning, commitment, the pursuit of opportunities and, above all, action, attitude in performing the TBC and leaving behind its goals.\n\nThe Coach is nothing more than a professional trained to assist individuals in taking the actions and attitudes necessary to achieve their goals and plans. Coach is a word that comes from English and means \"coach\". Its function is to contribute, through powerful techniques and questions, so that clients (also called Coachees) discover within themselves the answers they need to get everything they want within the shortest possible time.\n\nTHE COACHING PROCESS:\nCoaching is a goal-focused process with a well-defined beginning, middle and end. Within the process the Coach acts as a catalyst for Coachee's findings, utilizing high impact tools and questions. The goal of the coach is to generate the action itself, through powerful questions that will generate reflection, observations, questions and feedbacks.\n\nBEYOND COACHING:\nLynx also offers debt elimination, expense planning and investment advice.

A few years ago we’ve started to discover the various investment options available on the Internet. We’ve tried numerous HYIP, revshare and other hybrid programs and always hoped they won’t shut down ahead of time. Unfortunately our experience was rather disappointing, the vast majority of these sites didn’t last too long and sooner or later closed down. In most cases they suffered from different kinds of financial trouble, there was even a case when the system was hit by a cyber attack and couldn't resume business afterwards. The most secure solution seemed to be diversification, splitting our capital into 10-15 different investment programs. This way we could mitigate the risk since we deployed only a portion of our money in each system instead of risking all at one place. That method worked for us! We’ve had enough of the unreliability and constant uncertainty! We wanted a stable, reliable source of income that gives the opportunity also to others to earn a healthy passive revenue without being concerned about their money. This was our mission in creating this website where your profit is generated from a diversified portfolio of at least 15 different investment programs. You don’t buy a pig in a poke. Our website is constantly updated to show you the current portfolio, all the programs that we use to eliminate your investment risks. Our goal is a solution that stands the test of time and provides you a stable, reliable one stop shop for your investment needs.

We offer complete flexibility in lease options, from shell to server-ready leases and anything in between. This allows our customers to match their needs with their capital budgets. One of our most popular lease plans is the &quot;success based&quot; plan, which allows our customers to minimize capital expenses until they achieve the required revenue stream. \n\nServer Farm Realty works with our customers through the build process, giving them direct input in the data center design. This ensures that customer requirements are met and the cost is based on need—we build what you need as opposed to leasing you what we have.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/5000/server-farm-realty.jpg?1558036293","tags":[],"latLong":"33.91631,-118.40294","address":"999 S Sepulveda Blvd Ste 600, El Segundo, CA 90245, US","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Server-Farm-Realty-LLC/300387900087547","twitter":"https://twitter.com/SFR_DataCenters","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/server-farm-realty-inc."}},{"name":"ITOLAB","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth"],"description":"\nITOLab was founded in 2016.

As a result, you can solve simple passwords, arbitrarily complex forms, or simulate multi-step bank transactions (by processing incoming sms code if needed).\n\nWho and why is webDIAG useful?\nThe webDIAG service may be of interest to several target groups:\nAdministrators, Operators: The alert function of webDIAG provides a high level of security, as downtime and network failures are reported to a qualified technician within the shortest time, and logging and reporting provide helpful troubleshooting assistance.\nQuality Assurance department: WebDIAG statistics track server response times (which can suggest inferior scalability), and monitor weekly, monthly, and annual downtime when a web service was down. By monitoring the transactions, not only the operation of a page or a server (group) can be checked, but also a complete process (eg login with SMS, checking of current account, exit).\nMarketing Department: WebDIAG's objective and credible log data, reports, and statistics can be referenced in customer newsletters, advertising, thereby enhancing the company's customer-centric image and online commitment.\nSecurity Group: Using the webDIAG service, you can efficiently and quickly detect overloaded attacks, and even alert you if, for example, the content of a page changes.\nManagers, management: WebDIAG reports can be delivered directly to business executives (without the involvement of in-house IT specialists), so they can be used to evaluate the work of Web services colleagues.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/webdiag-hu.jpg?1568765017","tags":["IT","IT services"],"latLong":"47.513867,19.031914","address":"1024 Budapest, Buday László utca 12","socials":{}},{"name":"Wadsack.ch","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","dash"],"description":"\nAn der Bahnhofstrasse 7 in 6300 Zug betreuen wir nationale wie auch internationale Kunden in den Bereichen Steuern, Buchhaltung und Gestion.

I help clients both locally and out-of-state choose the appropriate entity type for their business, protect their intellectual property, and engender consumer trust, while managing risk, through the implementation of defensible data protection practices. I'm certified as an information privacy professional (CIPP/US) by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).\n\nOutside of work, my partner and I share our home with two rescued dogs and are avid supporters of Muttville Senior Dog Rescue. Boxing, yoga, and running through Golden Gate Park fill my free time.

Also, a Reddit post leading to your website and upvoted 50 times is worth more from a SEO perspective than packages sold for hundreds of dollars by other companies dedicated to this.

The aim since its foundation is to differentiate itself from the concept of a conventional IT company and to obtain specific character and specialization. Today that is mandatory; while the concept of the technological partner that has general knowledge in the entire spectrum of technology is far outdated. Nowadays a company’s technical partner is required to have deep knowledge of their field and to be able to provide innovative solutions that are efficient on resources. Innovation and technology can make the difference and that makes them not only a privilege but a necessity. This necessity is our job!\n\n\nSmart NS, having nearly 10 years of experience, have gained expertise on computer networks, IP telephony and supporting computer systems’ infrastructure. Undertaking the planning, installation and maintenance of computer networks and IP telephony systems, we transform them into essential tools for the everyday life of our customers.

As a result, you can solve simple passwords, arbitrarily complex forms, or simulate multi-step bank transactions (by processing incoming sms code if needed).\n\nWho and why is webDIAG useful?\nThe webDIAG service may be of interest to several target groups:\nAdministrators, Operators: The alert function of webDIAG provides a high level of security, as downtime and network failures are reported to a qualified technician within the shortest time, and logging and reporting provide helpful troubleshooting assistance.\nQuality Assurance department: WebDIAG statistics track server response times (which can suggest inferior scalability), and monitor weekly, monthly, and annual downtime when a web service was down. By monitoring the transactions, not only the operation of a page or a server (group) can be checked, but also a complete process (eg login with SMS, checking of current account, exit).\nMarketing Department: WebDIAG's objective and credible log data, reports, and statistics can be referenced in customer newsletters, advertising, thereby enhancing the company's customer-centric image and online commitment.\nSecurity Group: Using the webDIAG service, you can efficiently and quickly detect overloaded attacks, and even alert you if, for example, the content of a page changes.\nManagers, management: WebDIAG reports can be delivered directly to business executives (without the involvement of in-house IT specialists), so they can be used to evaluate the work of Web services colleagues.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/webdiag-hu.jpg?1568765017","tags":["IT","IT services"],"latLong":"47.513867,19.031914","address":"1024 Budapest, Buday László utca 12","socials":{}},{"name":"ICOservices.co","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nICOService is rewriting the way we organize, and will continue to improve the lives of many.

In 2013 we were looking for products and services we could sell for Bitcoin and stumbled on the unquestionable demand for these services.\n\nThe CoinCrack.com domain name was purchased before we even know what business we would be in. All we knew was that it would be Bitcoin related. So “Coin” comes from Bitcoin but “Crack”… it just made for a great alliteration and good brand name, like “CocaCola”. But remember kids – Crack is whack!\n\nOur Team\nThe CoinCrack team is made up of entrepreneurs, designers, developers, bloggers and social media gurus.\n\nWe all work remote – from home, cafes and co-working spaces spanning 4 countries.

I offer statistical consulting for research involving human thought/behavior: psychology, human services, management, organizational development, sociology, marketing, and other related fields. \n\nWhile teaching statistics I discovered how to explain difficult concepts in ways that are easy to understand. Next thing I knew the office staff was sending students with stats questions to me, then I was walking them through their projects. Through this I learned how to be a liaison between the statistics world and those who fear it (or just aren't interested). I truly enjoy bringing clarity to my clients, watching them impress their committees, bosses, and friends. \n\nI work on projects in any location - by delivering to you a complete statistical analysis via email, sharing step-by-step instructions to complete your own project by phone / video chat, or simply giving advice when you need it. At any phase in your project, I am glad to be of assistance. \n\nI received my Ph.D. in Organizational Psychology from Walden University in Minneapolis Minnesota, and also studied previously at Wright State University in Dayton Ohio. \n\nContact for appointment.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/5000/significant-difference-llc.jpg?1558036494","tags":[],"latLong":"32.715696,-117.154587","address":"4436 Figueroa Blvd, San Diego, CA 92109, US","socials":{}},{"name":"880 IT Services","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nOur contractors and technicians are available for work throughout California's San Francisco Bay Area.

I'm certified as an information privacy professional (CIPP/US) by the International Association of Privacy Professionals (IAPP).\n\nOutside of work, my partner and I share our home with two rescued dogs and are avid supporters of Muttville Senior Dog Rescue.

Moreover, we aim to help as many people as possible to gamble for their own personal reasons.\n\nWe launched on May 2014 with our first website DogecoinMachine.net. It was a slot machine game exclusively for Dogecoin. On August 2014, we decided to offer other, more popular cryptocurrencies to gamble with, so we opened Crypto-Games.net. Soon after launch, we added dice, which we continuously improve to offer our players the best experience. In September 2015, Blackjack was added and in October 2015, lottery joined the ranks. Roulette, our 5th game, was added in July 2016, Video Poker in December 2016 and 7th game, Plinko was added in May 2017.\n\nThe site is being operated by JuSi B.V., a Curacao-based private limited liability company, with the use of this license. We currently hold an international eGaming license under the legislation of Curacao.\n\nA little background about us: We’re a group of cryptocurrencies fans, who work in IT industries (Programmers and System engineers). We learned of Bitcoin back in 2011 and found it very interesting and promising. This led to the establishment of Crypto-Games.net!\n\nIf you have any queries, complaints or messages, please email us at [email protected], or leave us a message at our Official Bitcointalk Thread.

The server secret represents initial reels positions. The server seed is a cryptographically secure random alpha-numeric string. The hash of these 2 strings helps to ensure that the initial reels positions are not altered after you choose the number of lines and bet amount. After the game is finished the server secret and the server seed are revealed, so you can easily calculate and verify the hash.\n\nWhen you play a game you can pass an extra custom string – client seed (if it’s not specified a random number is automatically generated by your browser). The server will then calculate another hash using the server secret, the server seed and the client seed. The last 5 chars of this hash (representing a hexadecimal value) will be converted to an integer. Each digit in this number will result in an extra number of spins on the corresponding reel (from left to right). Because the client seed can not be predicted by the server the number of extra spins is completely random and hence you can be sure that the game result is fair.\n\nTo check that a game you played was fair go to History >> My games page, select a game and click Verify button.\n\nBots\nIn order to attract new customers to your casino it might be vital to have existing users base, which play games on a regular basis and thus increase credibility of your website. Don’t have customers yet? Bots come to the rescue!\n\nA casino administrator can easily generate any number of bots in the backend. These bots appear as regular users, but on a regular basis (e.g. every 5 minutes) some bots will “wake up” and play games with random parameters.\n\nBonuses\nREFERRAL PROGRAM\nEach user can earn bonus credits for referring other users to the casino. A casino administrator can configure the amount of bonus credits for the following events:\n\nSign up (both referee and referrer will receive fixed amount of bonus credits)\nGame loss (referrer will receive % of the net loss)\nGame win (referrer will receive % of the net win)\nDeposit (referrer will receive % of deposit amount) — requires Payments add-on\nSite-wide settings can be overridden on the user level.\n\nOTHER BONUSES\nRegular user sign up bonus\nGame loss cash back bonus\nGame win cash back bonus\nDeposit cash back bonus\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/matrix-casino.jpg?1570094302","tags":["Casino","Dice"],"latLong":"37.29591,9.872779","address":"Bizerte ain merim bougatfa 2, 673","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MTXcoin/?modal=admin_todo_tour","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Matrixcoin2","telegram":"https://t.me/MTXmatrixcoin1","github":"https://github.com/mtx-coin","discord":"https://discord.gg/ZPaf6EK"}},{"name":"BitStarz","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","ltc","doge"],"description":"\nAT BITSTARZ, WE ARE PLAYERS TOO\nThere are many casinos out there, and everyone is claiming to have some unique twist to it.

In today’s online casino and poker sites use a centralized random number generator (RNG) , which is influenced from the outside. For example, the owner of the resource can influence on the process and the outcome of the game, have access to the server and the software code. This system causes distrust from users. Cheating with cards or the “bloody hand” in card games is often mentioned. Decentralized system and Blockchain technology can solve this problem.\n\nThe primary objective of our project is to bring an online poker room for messengers (WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook) to the market.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/cash-poker-pro.jpg?1552854416","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/cashpokerpro","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CashPokPro","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cashpoker","telegram":"https://t.me/cashpokerpro","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWaro6TO8t28Q0fHP0leEbw","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CashPokerPro","medium":"https://medium.com/@CashPokPro"}},{"name":"FairPlay.io","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bsv","usdt","trx","ada","dash","etc","zec"],"description":"\nCasino honesty control goes to the hands of every player\n\nIn order to understand if the possibility of controlling casino honesty is realistic, you need to understand the mechanism of control called the TruePlay platform.

Its goal is to legitimize gambling with the help of blockchain technology. Obviously, both fair casinos and players themselves want to get transparency in gambling, and its absence puts the business in an awkward position in a number of countries. We are sure that the blockchain is able to change the situation radically.\n\nWhat gives the implantation of the technology to players and webmasters:\n\nA casino balance control\nA player can check the casino’s balance and whether it pays winnings.\nA smart contract for a player\nA player can check if someone intervened in the course of the gaming session and id someone changed the probability of winning. It is possible thanks to a smart contract based on Ethereum.\nA lifelong binding\nCasinos’ attempts to cheat webmasters are one of the main problems of the industry. But the casino won’t be able to hide the activity of the invited player from the affiliate due to the smart contract. The casino loses the levers of evading payouts unless it decides to commit fraud in an obvious way.\n\nT-3 Module\n\nThe above-described is possible thanks to the technology called T-3 Module which stands for Transparency, Trust, Trueplay.\n\nThe system works as follows:\n\nGame events (bet and win) are proxied on the side of the game provider.\nA unique public digital key that transfers the saved data to the gaming platform is assigned to these events.\nThe accepted bets and winnings are retrieved from the response of the gaming platform.\nThis response is sent to the game provider. It generates an anonymous and signed private key value for game statistics for a specific game event (DateTime, game_id, round_id, player_uuid, bet, win).\nThe statistics are sent then to the Game Statistic Blockchain Publisher.\nThe publisher provides statistics in the blockchain.\nPlayers, authorities, and users of the TruePlay software obtain the game statistics data from the blockchain and verify them using the public key of the game provider.\n\n\n\nThe TPLAY Token\n\nTPLAY is a “chip” of online casinos involved in the project. This is a cryptocurrency that is used for mutual settlements in the TruePlay system. The player bets using TPLAY, and the casino makes payments to the winner and affiliate with the same tokens. The Bitcoin (Ethereum) to TPLAY conversion and the reverse conversion take place in the TruePlay Wallet automatically. Withdrawals occur on the same wallet from which they were deposited.\n\nWhy do these “chips” are important? \n\nVersatility of tokens\n\nThe TruePlay technology is implemented in the Fairplay.io casino. Other online gambling houses will be connected to the project in the near future. In order to make life easier for all involved in the process including the players, it was decided to create a single base for the project partners. The unified login, the unified wallet, and the unified currency called TPLAY. A gambler played at Fairplay a bit and then he went to finish playing at another casino, and at will, he came back. No additional registration, no extra conversion of funds, no additional transfers and required deposits, no waste of time. It's like shopping in a shopping district.\n\nSmart contract as a guarantee of fair play\n\nIf in simple terms, a smart contract is a protocol in the form of program code that is stored in the “cloud”. The protocol obliges his signatories to comply with the contract including the point of penalties for failure to comply with the contract. The cryptographic basis of a smart contract does not allow its ambiguous interpretations and retroactive contract changes. Usually, it is used for the automated exchange of assets without intermediaries.\n\nThe blockchain technology which serves as the basis for a smart contract is required to verify the integrity of the contract execution on specialized independent resources.\n\nDeposit and withdrawal of funds\n\nSpeaking about the smart contract it’s needed to say about the deposits and withdrawals. Currently, TruePlay Wallet is working with the most popular and trusted cryptocurrencies which are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Also, the opportunity of withdrawing money via Skrill has appeared recently. The developers plan to connect other cryptocurrencies and fiat money too. Withdrawal takes a minimum of time, it’s up to one working day. But often that operation takes just a few minutes.\n\nThe operation of withdrawing currency from a casino is elementary. It’s enough to take the following steps:\n\nLogin to your account\nClick the \"Recharge\" button\nSelect the “Withdraw” tab\nEnter the information of the wallet from which the deposit was made\nThat’s it, you can make a withdrawal\n\n\nThe Fairplay.io casino availability\n\nThe casino works without additional software on PC and mobile devices. The game speed is high. Third-party applications are not required. You need only one of the popular browsers, for example:\n\nGoogle Chrome\nOpera\nMozilla Firefox\n\nDemo mode and a player motivation\n\nYou need not only a high-quality technical component of the project for a positive experience of visitors but also the opportunity to “feel” the project personally without risks to the wallet and to the anonymity. Fairplay provides such an opportunity:\n\nDemo games\nEach game can be tried for free in order to not only evaluate its graphics and performance but also to “feel” the game.\nFree tokens for a newcomer\nA person immediately receives 100 TPLAY (equivalent to 0.1 ETH) into his wallet after registration. The amount may seem small, but this is a real opportunity to tickle your nerves.\n\nFor players who like both TruePlay and Fairplay, the special offers program doesn’t end there. They will gain large bonuses for the first deposits as well as weekly bonuses in the form of free spins, cash-backs, and increased deposits. The technical support will help to solve any questions if the gambler has any as soon as possible. The Fairplay technical support works around the clock. The communication is available by calling, by online chatting using website applications, and by popular messengers like WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nThe first experience with Fairplay will be even more pleasant in material terms thanks to the bonus that will be credited to you for the first deposit if you will use this link.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/fairplay-io.jpg?1558085055","tags":["Casino","Lottery"],"latLong":"17.189482,-88.31325","address":"Belize","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/FairPlay.io","telegram":"https://t.me/fairplaysupport","whatsapp":"https://wa.me/79660262796"}},{"name":"Cheap Moving Companies","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nCheap moving Companies can be utilized for figuring out the organization that will help you to move the nation over.

User can choose how many paylines to bet in each round (1 to 20).\n\nWILDS AND SCATTERS\nWild symbols replace any regular symbol (except scatter). Scatter symbols win when they appear on the reels in any place. They also offer greater payouts and multiply your total bet.\n\nCUSTOM BETS\nUser can choose how much to bet per line.\n\nPROVABLY FAIR\nWhen you open the game page the server generates a secret and a seed and reveals its hash (using HMAC SHA256 algorithm). The server secret represents initial reels positions. The server seed is a cryptographically secure random alpha-numeric string. The hash of these 2 strings helps to ensure that the initial reels positions are not altered after you choose the number of lines and bet amount. After the game is finished the server secret and the server seed are revealed, so you can easily calculate and verify the hash.\n\nWhen you play a game you can pass an extra custom string – client seed (if it’s not specified a random number is automatically generated by your browser). The server will then calculate another hash using the server secret, the server seed and the client seed. The last 5 chars of this hash (representing a hexadecimal value) will be converted to an integer. Each digit in this number will result in an extra number of spins on the corresponding reel (from left to right). Because the client seed can not be predicted by the server the number of extra spins is completely random and hence you can be sure that the game result is fair.\n\nTo check that a game you played was fair go to History >> My games page, select a game and click Verify button.\n\nBots\nIn order to attract new customers to your casino it might be vital to have existing users base, which play games on a regular basis and thus increase credibility of your website. Don’t have customers yet? Bots come to the rescue!\n\nA casino administrator can easily generate any number of bots in the backend. These bots appear as regular users, but on a regular basis (e.g. every 5 minutes) some bots will “wake up” and play games with random parameters.\n\nBonuses\nREFERRAL PROGRAM\nEach user can earn bonus credits for referring other users to the casino. A casino administrator can configure the amount of bonus credits for the following events:\n\nSign up (both referee and referrer will receive fixed amount of bonus credits)\nGame loss (referrer will receive % of the net loss)\nGame win (referrer will receive % of the net win)\nDeposit (referrer will receive % of deposit amount) — requires Payments add-on\nSite-wide settings can be overridden on the user level.\n\nOTHER BONUSES\nRegular user sign up bonus\nGame loss cash back bonus\nGame win cash back bonus\nDeposit cash back bonus\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/7000/matrix-casino.jpg?1570094302","tags":["Casino","Dice"],"latLong":"37.29591,9.872779","address":"Bizerte ain merim bougatfa 2, 673","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/MTXcoin/?modal=admin_todo_tour","twitter":"https://twitter.com/Matrixcoin2","telegram":"https://t.me/MTXmatrixcoin1","github":"https://github.com/mtx-coin","discord":"https://discord.gg/ZPaf6EK"}},{"name":"VBet","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\n40,000+\nLive matches per month\nVbet.com covers over 30,000 Live matches per month, offering gamecasts with detailed direct-from-the-field animations.

Its goal is to legitimize gambling with the help of blockchain technology. Obviously, both fair casinos and players themselves want to get transparency in gambling, and its absence puts the business in an awkward position in a number of countries. We are sure that the blockchain is able to change the situation radically.\n\nWhat gives the implantation of the technology to players and webmasters:\n\nA casino balance control\nA player can check the casino’s balance and whether it pays winnings.\nA smart contract for a player\nA player can check if someone intervened in the course of the gaming session and id someone changed the probability of winning. It is possible thanks to a smart contract based on Ethereum.\nA lifelong binding\nCasinos’ attempts to cheat webmasters are one of the main problems of the industry. But the casino won’t be able to hide the activity of the invited player from the affiliate due to the smart contract. The casino loses the levers of evading payouts unless it decides to commit fraud in an obvious way.\n\nT-3 Module\n\nThe above-described is possible thanks to the technology called T-3 Module which stands for Transparency, Trust, Trueplay.\n\nThe system works as follows:\n\nGame events (bet and win) are proxied on the side of the game provider.\nA unique public digital key that transfers the saved data to the gaming platform is assigned to these events.\nThe accepted bets and winnings are retrieved from the response of the gaming platform.\nThis response is sent to the game provider. It generates an anonymous and signed private key value for game statistics for a specific game event (DateTime, game_id, round_id, player_uuid, bet, win).\nThe statistics are sent then to the Game Statistic Blockchain Publisher.\nThe publisher provides statistics in the blockchain.\nPlayers, authorities, and users of the TruePlay software obtain the game statistics data from the blockchain and verify them using the public key of the game provider.\n\n\n\nThe TPLAY Token\n\nTPLAY is a “chip” of online casinos involved in the project. This is a cryptocurrency that is used for mutual settlements in the TruePlay system. The player bets using TPLAY, and the casino makes payments to the winner and affiliate with the same tokens. The Bitcoin (Ethereum) to TPLAY conversion and the reverse conversion take place in the TruePlay Wallet automatically. Withdrawals occur on the same wallet from which they were deposited.\n\nWhy do these “chips” are important? \n\nVersatility of tokens\n\nThe TruePlay technology is implemented in the Fairplay.io casino. Other online gambling houses will be connected to the project in the near future. In order to make life easier for all involved in the process including the players, it was decided to create a single base for the project partners. The unified login, the unified wallet, and the unified currency called TPLAY. A gambler played at Fairplay a bit and then he went to finish playing at another casino, and at will, he came back. No additional registration, no extra conversion of funds, no additional transfers and required deposits, no waste of time. It's like shopping in a shopping district.\n\nSmart contract as a guarantee of fair play\n\nIf in simple terms, a smart contract is a protocol in the form of program code that is stored in the “cloud”. The protocol obliges his signatories to comply with the contract including the point of penalties for failure to comply with the contract. The cryptographic basis of a smart contract does not allow its ambiguous interpretations and retroactive contract changes. Usually, it is used for the automated exchange of assets without intermediaries.\n\nThe blockchain technology which serves as the basis for a smart contract is required to verify the integrity of the contract execution on specialized independent resources.\n\nDeposit and withdrawal of funds\n\nSpeaking about the smart contract it’s needed to say about the deposits and withdrawals. Currently, TruePlay Wallet is working with the most popular and trusted cryptocurrencies which are Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). Also, the opportunity of withdrawing money via Skrill has appeared recently. The developers plan to connect other cryptocurrencies and fiat money too. Withdrawal takes a minimum of time, it’s up to one working day. But often that operation takes just a few minutes.\n\nThe operation of withdrawing currency from a casino is elementary. It’s enough to take the following steps:\n\nLogin to your account\nClick the \"Recharge\" button\nSelect the “Withdraw” tab\nEnter the information of the wallet from which the deposit was made\nThat’s it, you can make a withdrawal\n\n\nThe Fairplay.io casino availability\n\nThe casino works without additional software on PC and mobile devices. The game speed is high. Third-party applications are not required. You need only one of the popular browsers, for example:\n\nGoogle Chrome\nOpera\nMozilla Firefox\n\nDemo mode and a player motivation\n\nYou need not only a high-quality technical component of the project for a positive experience of visitors but also the opportunity to “feel” the project personally without risks to the wallet and to the anonymity. Fairplay provides such an opportunity:\n\nDemo games\nEach game can be tried for free in order to not only evaluate its graphics and performance but also to “feel” the game.\nFree tokens for a newcomer\nA person immediately receives 100 TPLAY (equivalent to 0.1 ETH) into his wallet after registration. The amount may seem small, but this is a real opportunity to tickle your nerves.\n\nFor players who like both TruePlay and Fairplay, the special offers program doesn’t end there. They will gain large bonuses for the first deposits as well as weekly bonuses in the form of free spins, cash-backs, and increased deposits. The technical support will help to solve any questions if the gambler has any as soon as possible. The Fairplay technical support works around the clock. The communication is available by calling, by online chatting using website applications, and by popular messengers like WhatsApp and Telegram.\n\nThe first experience with Fairplay will be even more pleasant in material terms thanks to the bonus that will be credited to you for the first deposit if you will use this link.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/fairplay-io.jpg?1558085055","tags":["Casino","Lottery"],"latLong":"17.189482,-88.31325","address":"Belize","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/messages/t/FairPlay.io","telegram":"https://t.me/fairplaysupport","whatsapp":"https://wa.me/79660262796"}},{"name":"MegaWins","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nMegawins is a licensed online casino that sets the highest standards in terms of entertainment and safe online gaming.

But his real passion… is Bitcoin.\n\nBack in 2009, BitKong was already stacking mbits like a king, which is why some believe he is the original Satoshi, still hoarding coins deep within the jungle. Others think that's silly. But whatever you believe, being a Bitcoin millionaire is not enough of a thrill for this Gigantopethicus.

The prizes are predefined when you press start, and your luck is the only thing that matters. This means that BitKong is 100% verifiably fair. Go ahead and look.\n\nThe ground shakes. “So you want to be the new king of the jungle?\", BitKong mimes in sign language. “Give it a go, and see if you can be the hero of this story. Maybe you'll be lucky, but keep your hands off the girls I have in my cave.\"\n\nTravellers have known to return from his lair in their underpants, staring at their feet and sighing, “Well, at least he wasn't a loan shark!\". Others groaned at his puns, and bought themselves a rolex with their winnings.

What our team intends to do is integrate gaming industry with another emerging technology of blockchain. Blockchain is one of the most impressive technology that has the capacity to revolutionize the way world functions. However, it is still to take a corporeal form, it still has to overcome certain set of difficulties. Since the idea of blockchain is based in transparency, fairness, and collective effort, the only way to advance the blockchain is through collective effort. And we, as a team, wish to add some of our own effort into that collective pool. We are a team who believes in the potential of blockchain. And as a part of our effort we wish to change the way gaming works. While there are numerous gaming platforms that use crypto currency, they are limited to simpler games. We start a step ahead of other games, with a comparatively more complex betting game, and then move even further and add more complex and more interesting games. Our starting project, Crown and Anchor Betting Game, will be based on TRON network and provide uses to more interesting gaming and betting experience than other simpler crypto-currency based games.\n\nUnlike other dice games, users don't have to set the winning ratio as it is determined by the dices after they are rolled. In other words, the betting model is completely based on the decentralized wining ratio. The currency we are using on our project is a TRON based independent currency called Crown and Anchor Token (CAT) named after our first game Crown and Token dice game. The CAT has a max supply of 10 billion and is proportionately divided for ICO, mining, promotion and other operational purposes. While CAT is used for the gaming purposes, meaning you will play with and win in CATs, TRX will be the actual win. TRX is tightly associated and you will earn the dividends in TRX, making our project lot flexible and accessible to even beginners.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/troncat.jpg?1553005578","tags":["Lottery","Special"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/troncatorg","twitter":"https://twitter.com/TronCat_Org","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/F2pc8hbVOdvIptgE8NgtJg"}},{"name":"Ethex","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nFair and cheat-free ETH-Lottery.

What our team intends to do is integrate gaming industry with another emerging technology of blockchain. Blockchain is one of the most impressive technology that has the capacity to revolutionize the way world functions. However, it is still to take a corporeal form, it still has to overcome certain set of difficulties. Since the idea of blockchain is based in transparency, fairness, and collective effort, the only way to advance the blockchain is through collective effort. And we, as a team, wish to add some of our own effort into that collective pool. We are a team who believes in the potential of blockchain. And as a part of our effort we wish to change the way gaming works. While there are numerous gaming platforms that use crypto currency, they are limited to simpler games. We start a step ahead of other games, with a comparatively more complex betting game, and then move even further and add more complex and more interesting games. Our starting project, Crown and Anchor Betting Game, will be based on TRON network and provide uses to more interesting gaming and betting experience than other simpler crypto-currency based games.\n\nUnlike other dice games, users don't have to set the winning ratio as it is determined by the dices after they are rolled. In other words, the betting model is completely based on the decentralized wining ratio. The currency we are using on our project is a TRON based independent currency called Crown and Anchor Token (CAT) named after our first game Crown and Token dice game. The CAT has a max supply of 10 billion and is proportionately divided for ICO, mining, promotion and other operational purposes. While CAT is used for the gaming purposes, meaning you will play with and win in CATs, TRX will be the actual win. TRX is tightly associated and you will earn the dividends in TRX, making our project lot flexible and accessible to even beginners.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/troncat.jpg?1553005578","tags":["Lottery","Special"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/troncatorg","twitter":"https://twitter.com/TronCat_Org","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/F2pc8hbVOdvIptgE8NgtJg"}},{"name":"BingoBet - American Roulette and Dice","cryptocurrencies":["eos"],"description":"\nThe first American Roulette is made fully trustless on the fastest and feeless EOS blockchain!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/bingobet---american-roulette-and-dice.jpg?1552854238","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/bingobet_one","telegram":"https://t.me/bingobet_one","medium":"https://medium.com/bingobet"}},{"name":"Ethex","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nFair and cheat-free ETH-Lottery.

The result is an intimate, boutique hotel/casino that is energetic and contemporary, yet preserves its historic character.\nThe hotel’s new luxury suites present a fresh and contemporary feel, blended with styling that spans the decades. Each is themed with Swing era-inspired pinstriped carpeting; Art Deco accents; and a photograph of an iconic Las\n\nVegas celebrity, many of whom frequented Golden Gate. All suites are climate-controlled with motion sensors and boast a 50-inch HD flat-screen TV, California king bed and sectional sofa with a queen-size pullout. The Golden Gate also features 106 recently remodeled rooms that date back to the 1906 opening.

The system exists solely within the RAM of an abandoned Nokia 3310 mobile phone which was left in a subway station in Tokyo, and powers itself by feeding off the ghost of the late Satoshi Nakamoto (who was in fact a super hot 20 yr old female Japanese programmer and exotic animal collector). While the Intelligence decides on its next course of action, it runs this SatoshiDice subroutine. Some people ask why Bitcoin was really created... it was created by the Intelligence as an internet currency which enables free individuals around the world to play the SatoshiDice game. By playing, you are fulfilling the Intelligence's Grand Vision.\n\nOn the specifics of the system: The SatoshiDice Bitcoin game operates with zero confirmations, meaning the time it takes for you to send a transaction and receive your winnings is near-instant. Bets are evaluated as soon as the client picks up the broadcast. This is safe because it always builds the answering transaction with the output of your bet transaction. This means a blockchain that does not contain your bet cannot contain the site's answer.\n\nYou place a bet by sending bitcoins to one of the addresses listed in the bet options table. SatoshiDice sees this, evaluates win or lose and generates a return transaction. If you win, your bet is multiplied by the prize multiplier and that amount is sent back.\n\nMinimum Deposit: 0.0005 BCH\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/satoshidice.jpg?1550646835","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/SatoshiDICE"}},{"name":"King Billy Casino","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","ltc","doge"],"description":"\nThere are some games all players worth their salt recognize, unless they‘ve been in a coma for the last quarter of a century.

Literally translated, “Sic Bo” means “dice pair”, making the game’s name a contradiction since it is played with three dice. It is known for various names around the world, some including Tai Sai, Chinese Dice, Big and Small, Hi-Lo, etc.\n\nIt has been played since ancient times and is a popular casino game in Asia especially in Macau. In the early 20th century, Sic Bo was introduced to the United States by Chinese immigrants. Since then, it can now be found in most American casinos.\n\nNow, Sic Bo can be played online via this blockchain-based game, Cryptodice! Using a smart contract powered by Ethereum, Cryptodice’s results are always met with honest results.\n\nThe game is simple and easy to understand. Its goal is to gamble on the outcome of the three dice to be rolled. Make your bet by choosing a chip size, then place it on the area of the virtual table corresponding to where you want to make your bet. You can make multiple bets to increase your chances of winning high rewards. Your bets on different segments in the table can also differ in amount.\n\nBut the game is only a hundred percent experienced once you start playing it. Immerse yourself in Cryptodice!

The system exists solely within the RAM of an abandoned Nokia 3310 mobile phone which was left in a subway station in Tokyo, and powers itself by feeding off the ghost of the late Satoshi Nakamoto (who was in fact a super hot 20 yr old female Japanese programmer and exotic animal collector). While the Intelligence decides on its next course of action, it runs this SatoshiDice subroutine. Some people ask why Bitcoin was really created... it was created by the Intelligence as an internet currency which enables free individuals around the world to play the SatoshiDice game. By playing, you are fulfilling the Intelligence's Grand Vision.\n\nOn the specifics of the system: The SatoshiDice Bitcoin game operates with zero confirmations, meaning the time it takes for you to send a transaction and receive your winnings is near-instant. Bets are evaluated as soon as the client picks up the broadcast. This is safe because it always builds the answering transaction with the output of your bet transaction. This means a blockchain that does not contain your bet cannot contain the site's answer.\n\nYou place a bet by sending bitcoins to one of the addresses listed in the bet options table. SatoshiDice sees this, evaluates win or lose and generates a return transaction. If you win, your bet is multiplied by the prize multiplier and that amount is sent back.\n\nMinimum Deposit: 0.0005 BCH\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/satoshidice.jpg?1550646835","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/SatoshiDICE"}},{"name":"BitcoinCasino.us","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","ltc"],"description":"\nBitcoinCasino.us\n\nMinimum Deposit: 0.01 BTC\nMinimum Withdrawal: None\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/bitcoincasino-us.jpg?1548414767","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/bitcoincasino.us/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/USBitcoinCasino"}},{"name":"CryptoDice","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nCryptodice is a game of chance, based on the ancient Chinese Dice Game “Sic Bo”.

Literally translated, “Sic Bo” means “dice pair”, making the game’s name a contradiction since it is played with three dice. It is known for various names around the world, some including Tai Sai, Chinese Dice, Big and Small, Hi-Lo, etc.\n\nIt has been played since ancient times and is a popular casino game in Asia especially in Macau. In the early 20th century, Sic Bo was introduced to the United States by Chinese immigrants. Since then, it can now be found in most American casinos.\n\nNow, Sic Bo can be played online via this blockchain-based game, Cryptodice! Using a smart contract powered by Ethereum, Cryptodice’s results are always met with honest results.\n\nThe game is simple and easy to understand. Its goal is to gamble on the outcome of the three dice to be rolled. Make your bet by choosing a chip size, then place it on the area of the virtual table corresponding to where you want to make your bet. You can make multiple bets to increase your chances of winning high rewards. Your bets on different segments in the table can also differ in amount.\n\nBut the game is only a hundred percent experienced once you start playing it. Immerse yourself in Cryptodice!

The new dice game gives you the possibility to place streaks of bets that are blizzard fast and visually stunning. Bets are returned in ~20ms and there's daily leader boards and a cutting edge provably fair system. New games are being added, bringing players an exclusive bitcoin casino experience.\n\nAs you can see, this was merely the beginning of Bitcoin gambling. Lots has happened since then; double spend attacks on losing bets took away the zero confirmation bet processing, so now we have to wait for wide adoption of technologies like the Lightning Network before instant blockchain bets can be available again. Lucky players have busted the whole bankroll in the past, helping us to realise that the best way to handle a crowd funded bankroll is to apply a Kelly Criterion.\n\nBeyond Pure Bitcoin Dice Gambling - Lots of Casino Games!\nMegaDice offers the Bitcoin exclusive games Satoshi Slot and the Odd Even live casino game. Satoshi Slot is a provably fair Bitcoin-exclusive slot game where you enter the bonus game mode by getting 3 or more Bitcoin symbols. If you pick the right coin in the bonus game, 40 wilds will be inserted into the reels and you can win up to 513 times your bet for each spin. Other games that are newcomers at MegaDice are the Quickspin slot games.\n\nA Casino that Lets You Play as the House\nYou can choose to play as the house by betting on the shared bankroll. This means that the house edge is on your side. Whenever a player wins or loses, you get your proportional share of the house's bankroll. This is a great opportunity to win some bitcoins with the historically stable rise of the casino's winnings.\n\nThe Next Level of Bitcoin Gambling\nWith higher xp and level comes not only great responsibility but also great rewards. Bitcoin prizes are given out as you raise in level and extra bonuses are given out on big winning streaks. Affiliate earnings are given to you in real time. All bets and wins by players referred by you are immediately counted towards your account and you can withdraw at any time you choose. Just lean back and watch your balance grow. New Bitcoin games are added over time and we give out bonuses to players who try all our bitcoin games.\n\nMinimum Deposit: None\nMinimum Withdrawal: None\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/megadice.jpg?1548414449","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Mandarin Palace","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nFrom the Far East to the most western corner, Mandarin Palace Online Casino has become legendary for bestowing upon its players some of the best casino rewards in the spirit of prosperity and fortune - a tradition that is closely guarded by the dragon for the sake of all who call this online...Show more...From the Far East to the most western corner, Mandarin Palace Online Casino has become legendary for bestowing upon its players some of the best casino rewards in the spirit of prosperity and fortune - a tradition that is closely guarded by the dragon for the sake of all who call this online casino, home.\n\nMandarin Palace Casino has been in operation since 2009 and ensures the latest in security practices and technology in order to ensure the safety and security of its players.

Naturally, these limits and restrictions have been instated by Valve to minimize fraud but at the same time it cuts down trading activity between players.\n\nAs passionate traders (and gamers) we, the founders, set out to provide what all gamers want: speed and availability. That where all has started for GamerAll and later has been achieved by stocking all products rather than relying on player listings and by integrating all major payment methods worldwide. The initial focus was on CS:GO skins but over the course of next few years our selection quickly grew to include all games with significant trading activity on Steam.\n\nIt is important to note that GamerAll.com is not a standalone trading hub that competes with the Steam marketplace. Instead it is an an extension of the Steam marketplace with more payment options, faster deliveries, and fewer restrictions. All items sold on GamerAll.com originate from the Steam marketplace or via trusted suppliers. We simply aquire them and make them more accessible to players worldwide.\n\nGamerAll Vision and Goals\nOur present goal is to provide a complete one stop shop for gamers where they can grab new releases for pc and consoles, top up their online wallets, fetch time cards, buy choice skins in the most popular online games, order high performance VPNs, and even purchase gaming accessories. We aspire to offer all of this before the end of 2019 and during 2020 we hope to realize our ultimate ambition of stepping into esports both as an event organizer and sponsor. And if all goes according to plan we will be looking into acquiring and managing our very own Gamerall esports team. There are many steps along the way but with your support we are confident we can make it happen.\n\nGamerAll Now\nAs of 2019 we sell items and skins for CS:GO, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, H1Z1, Rust, and Escape from Tarkov, and in our steadily expanding product range you will also find in stock over 2.500 digital games spanning across platforms such as Steam, Origin, Battle.net, Uplay, GOG.com, Xbox One, and PS4.\n\nWe are incorporated as Smart Experiences FZC (Free Zone Company) in UAE, Umm Al Quwain.\n\nSmart Experiences currently has around 20 employees with offices in UAE and China. Smart Experiences is looking to establish and perpetuate a strong brand name for affordable digital products for gamers.

Bitcoin and ether are cryptocurrencies but CryptoKitties are cryptocollectibles. You can buy, sell, or trade your CryptoKitty like it was a traditional collectible, secure in the knowledge that blockchain will track ownership securely.\n\nIn CryptoKitties, users collect and breed oh-so-adorable creatures that we call CryptoKitties! Each kitty has a unique genome that defines its appearance and traits. Players can breed their kitties to create new furry friends and unlock rare cattributes.\n\nCryptoKitties is one of the world’s first blockchain games. ‘Blockchain’ is the technology that makes things like Bitcoin possible. While CryptoKitties isn’t a digital currency, it does offer the same security: each CryptoKitty is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you. It cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.\n\nWhat we believe in, what we stand for, and why we’re building CryptoKitties.\n\nThe future is exciting.\n\nAnd we believe that blockchain is the future—but blockchain is about as approachable as a bunch of ones and zeroes.\n\nWe want a future for everyone, not one exclusive to Bitcoin miners, VCs, ICOs, and other equally fun acronyms.\n\nSo why cats?\n\nPop quiz, hotshot: why not?\n\nCats are impossible to understand. They’re ambassadors for pharaohs, memes, and your mom’s facebook page. They don’t discriminate; they despise everyone equally.\n\nCats are perfect killing machines, with retractable claws, night vision, and teeth on their tongue. But cats also nap whenever they feel like it, and we respect that.\n\nMore than anything, cats are different. They’re weird, funny, and hopelessly entertaining. You don’t have to understand cats to appreciate them.\n\nWe’re not trying to build the future—we’re trying to have fun with it.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/cryptokitties.jpg?1552852151","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CryptoKitties/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/cryptokitties","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/cryptokitties/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClUgQBJcxAmHjOQgV4QgVXg","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoKitties/","discord":"https://discord.gg/3GvT66U"}},{"name":"overclockers.co.uk","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch"],"description":"\nOverclockers UK offers the widest range of components and peripherals for your gaming PC needs.

Keys4Coins is one of the first pc game stores who only accept cryptocurrency as payment. Our store is simple to use and you can shop anonymously. We do not require any registration of customer details. Checkout is quick and simple. Only an e-mail is required so you can receive the license.\n\nWhy are Crypto Currencies better than ‘real money’?\nWe believe Crypto Currencies are real money quite honestly as they hold a monetary value.\n\nAutomatic instant delivery\nBecause we ship digital downloadable games instead of physical, delivery can be done on email.\nOur system is completely automatic and offer instant delivery.\nWhen you make a purchase, the license key will be sent on your email.\n\nHow do we get the keys this cheap?\nOur CD keys/licenses are bought from major distributors. Keys are scanned from their original retail boxes.\nRetail stores usually have to use the prices their publishers set.We are not tied to publishers and can offer friendlier prices than official stores.\n\nIt’s faster and cheaper\nAs this is a digital currency this allows transactions to be nearly instantaneous and safer than real world currencies.\nDigital currency has low transaction fees and exchanges has much lower fees than credit card processors.

This means you get INSTANT delivery of your game CD Keys!\n\nOur prices are always below retail price, and because the activation code is sent to you digitally, there are no expensive shipping costs to pay.\n\nOur company functions by importing the games from main distributors in other countries, where games have cheaper retail prices than in countries such as Australia or Israel. Because of the savings made in postage costs (as our items are sent digitally), it allows us to provide extremely low pricing. Not only this, but the games work worlwide as digital downloads, unlike physical games which sometimes have region locked discs.\n\nWe always strive to get our prices as low as possible, and we can always beat your quote! If you found a game store selling one of our games cheaper than us, send an email with proof and we'll beat the price!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/cjs-cdkeys-com.jpg?1","tags":["For gamers","Keys"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CJSCDKEYS/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CJS_CD_Keys"},"paymentGateways":["CoinPayments","BitPay"]},{"name":"Slots.io","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nSlots.io is a new slots-casino featuring several casino and card games.

As a spin-off from the highly successful Crab War, it takes a giant leap towards the future of Crypto gaming! \n\nThe concept of this crypto sport is inspired by the popular traditional 'Betta Fish Fight', a hobby that originates from Southeast Asia and is even recognized by the King of Thailand. Just as each fighting fish has their own unique combination of colours, patterns and fins, CryptantCrabs have their own unique markings, parts and elements that re-imagine the concept of the fighting fish. Train, mutate or challenge the multitude of Crabs and watch as you gain the appreciation of other CryptantCrab Challengers from across the world. \n\nYour one-of-a-kind CryptantCrab will have a chance to go down in history as a sought-after legend that turns your time spent on it into an investment of irreplaceable value.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/cryptantcrab.jpg?1552852738","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CryptantCrab","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CryptantCrab","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptantCrab/","medium":"https://medium.com/@cryptantcrab","discord":"https://discordapp.com/invite/S34AVrU"}},{"name":"Casdep Casino","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nFiat: AUD, CAD, DKK, EUR, NOK, NZD, SEK, USD\nMinimum Deposit: $10\nMinimum Withdrawal: $25\nRestrictions: Denmark, France, Hungary, Latvia, Netherlands, Portugal, Singapore, Turkey, United Kingdom, United States\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/casdep-casino.jpg?1550682189","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"0xWarriors","cryptocurrencies":["eos","trx"],"description":"\nIn 0xWarriors there is an unlimited number of heroes to collect and train.

Each dragon has its own unique attributes and appearance, such as cuteness or coolness. \n\nFurthermore, dragons can represent players and fight in matches, giving a reason for players to carefully train their warrior dragons. Players train their warrior dragons by boosting their hit point, skills, and glory – the three core features that strengthen a dragon.

Our goal is to treat you like a valued customer, not just another number. We want to earn your business and want to be your one stop shop for all your collectible needs. \n\nWe have hundreds of contacts to get merchandise. Therefore we are able to locate and get hard to find Magic: The Gathering, Pokemon, Star Wars, Yu-Gi-Oh!, and other various collectibles in as little as a few hours! We also guarantee all of our products to be 100% authentic. \n\n\"You can expect professional, fast, courteous, and competitive service.\"\n\nAll packages are shipped via FedEx, UPS or U.S. Mail usually within 48 hours (pending all items you ordered are in stock and your payment has been processed). We believe these carriers are the best in the business to get your order to you safely and as quickly as possible. If you ever wonder where your order is, just contact us and we'll track it for you immediately. \n\nWe want your shopping experience to be the best it can be here at Collectors Cache. We realize that a small percentage of our customers have the need to return merchandise and thus we have instituted the following return policy. \n\n\n\nAttention customers! We just moved our retail store to a new location. We are now located at the intersection of College Blvd & Pflumm in Lenexa, Kansas. Our new address is: 13354 College Blvd. Lenexa, KS 66210. If you're ever in the Greater Kansas City area drop by our massive retail store to say hello or play in one of our tournaments. With 9,000 square feet of space, holding large tournaments is no problem at all. We have worked many years to provide a clean, safe, well-stocked store for all our customers, and a great place to play Magic, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh!, miniature games, video games, and other CCG's. \n\nLastly, we want to sincerely thank our customers for all the support throughout the years. Back in 1988, we started as a small baseball card store with only 400 total square feet of space. As we continuously adapted to the fast paced changing collectible market, we slowly grew in to what now most would call a gamer's paradise.

Naturally, these limits and restrictions have been instated by Valve to minimize fraud but at the same time it cuts down trading activity between players.\n\nAs passionate traders (and gamers) we, the founders, set out to provide what all gamers want: speed and availability. That where all has started for GamerAll and later has been achieved by stocking all products rather than relying on player listings and by integrating all major payment methods worldwide. The initial focus was on CS:GO skins but over the course of next few years our selection quickly grew to include all games with significant trading activity on Steam.\n\nIt is important to note that GamerAll.com is not a standalone trading hub that competes with the Steam marketplace. Instead it is an an extension of the Steam marketplace with more payment options, faster deliveries, and fewer restrictions. All items sold on GamerAll.com originate from the Steam marketplace or via trusted suppliers. We simply aquire them and make them more accessible to players worldwide.\n\nGamerAll Vision and Goals\nOur present goal is to provide a complete one stop shop for gamers where they can grab new releases for pc and consoles, top up their online wallets, fetch time cards, buy choice skins in the most popular online games, order high performance VPNs, and even purchase gaming accessories. We aspire to offer all of this before the end of 2019 and during 2020 we hope to realize our ultimate ambition of stepping into esports both as an event organizer and sponsor. And if all goes according to plan we will be looking into acquiring and managing our very own Gamerall esports team. There are many steps along the way but with your support we are confident we can make it happen.\n\nGamerAll Now\nAs of 2019 we sell items and skins for CS:GO, Dota 2, Team Fortress 2, H1Z1, Rust, and Escape from Tarkov, and in our steadily expanding product range you will also find in stock over 2.500 digital games spanning across platforms such as Steam, Origin, Battle.net, Uplay, GOG.com, Xbox One, and PS4.\n\nWe are incorporated as Smart Experiences FZC (Free Zone Company) in UAE, Umm Al Quwain.\n\nSmart Experiences currently has around 20 employees with offices in UAE and China.

Bitcoin and ether are cryptocurrencies but CryptoKitties are cryptocollectibles. You can buy, sell, or trade your CryptoKitty like it was a traditional collectible, secure in the knowledge that blockchain will track ownership securely.\n\nIn CryptoKitties, users collect and breed oh-so-adorable creatures that we call CryptoKitties! Each kitty has a unique genome that defines its appearance and traits. Players can breed their kitties to create new furry friends and unlock rare cattributes.\n\nCryptoKitties is one of the world’s first blockchain games. ‘Blockchain’ is the technology that makes things like Bitcoin possible. While CryptoKitties isn’t a digital currency, it does offer the same security: each CryptoKitty is one-of-a-kind and 100% owned by you. It cannot be replicated, taken away, or destroyed.\n\nWhat we believe in, what we stand for, and why we’re building CryptoKitties.\n\nThe future is exciting.\n\nAnd we believe that blockchain is the future—but blockchain is about as approachable as a bunch of ones and zeroes.\n\nWe want a future for everyone, not one exclusive to Bitcoin miners, VCs, ICOs, and other equally fun acronyms.\n\nSo why cats?\n\nPop quiz, hotshot: why not?\n\nCats are impossible to understand. They’re ambassadors for pharaohs, memes, and your mom’s facebook page.

Players begin their life as a Narco with an individual skill-set in one of the diverse seven districts. By performing various actions, Narcos can earn more respect in town, opening up more possibilities like buying better equipment, changing identity and recruiting new Narcos.\n\nNarcos can make their living by growing weed, processing cocaine, trading product at district markets or by raiding each other for profit. Since each district has its own economy with constantly changing fluctuating drug prices, players must choose wisely where and when to sell their dope.\nDopeRaider is built on top of the Ethereum network. Narcos are unique ERC-721 tokens and all in-game actions are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Since Ether is the in-game currency, profits are real and all actions have real life financial consequences.\n\nThe DopeRaider world is divided into seven districts with individual cultures, economy and speciality stores. Narcos travel the districts in search for items to improve their skills, a better price to buy/sell dope, or for Narcos to steal their stash.\n\nEach of the outer district is specialized in certain products. Lab Gear (an upgrade for processing) for example can only be bought in Chinatown. In the middle of the DopeRaider world lies Vice Island, the most dangerous of all districts which is dominated by black market trading. All items can be purchased here, but the prices can be very high.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/doperaider.jpg?1552852494","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/DopeRaider/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/doperaider","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/playdoperaider","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmm67N5yysyze7doghZlhqw/featured","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/doperaider/"}},{"name":"Offgamers.com","cryptocurrencies":["btc","bch"],"description":"\nOffGamers is an established global brand with over 10 years under our belt as the prominent online game store and distribution platform for gamers, game developers, and publishers.\n\nOur core vision is to continuously expand our payment and distribution channels in both traditional and online...Show more...OffGamers is an established global brand with over 10 years under our belt as the prominent online game store and distribution platform for gamers, game developers, and publishers.\n\nOur core vision is to continuously expand our payment and distribution channels in both traditional and online methods to further benefit our partners and customers.\n\nWhat does this mean for Developers and Publishers?\nEffortless Cross-Border Payments between local and international regions on a global platform that supports Collaborative Promotions.\n\nWhat about the Gamers?\nBetter relationship with our partners means better services, choices, and prices.

Strategy, politics and strength are the building blocks for turning a plot of land into an empire. \n\n*The Ethereum blockchain is our foundation. This means that every piece of land, its resources and other assets you purchase in the game are unique and owned by you. It cannot be taken by others players unless you decide to sell it.\n\n*Grow your assets: Build on and improve your land, increase resource production and enhance its value. As you increase the value of your land, you can choose to sell your land (and its assets) directly in our Marketplace to other players through smart contracts for real ether (can also sell in 3rd party marketplaces). \n\n*It’s competitive: Within the game, players build their land, strengthen their army, conquer European lands and rise in power. Players wage daily battles to earn the titles of Caesar or one of four senators. Winning is fairly straightforward - the army that holds the most land wins those titles; but there are many paths you can take on your way to power and many ways to deceive your opponents. Not strong enough to win Caesar on your own? Join an alliance, or farm a much needed or rare resource to sell in the market to grow in power.\n\n*The victor go the spoils: A percentage of all daily transactions in the marketplace are distributed directly via smart contracts - 1% to Caesar and 1% split among the Senators. You're earning real ether for your conquests! The game has awarded 6ETH+ and counting in total daily prizes since launch.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/cryptorome.jpg?1552852234","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CryptoRome/","twitter":"https://www.twitter.com/CryptoRome","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/HO5pEg4X7AFMoeXYbE-4hg","medium":"https://medium.com/cryptorome","discord":"https://discord.gg/RJBRkTx"}},{"name":"BMIgaming","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","ltc"],"description":"\nRedemption Games For Sale | Featured New Prize, Ticket, Token + Video Redemption Machines.

Keys4Coins is one of the first pc game stores who only accept cryptocurrency as payment. Our store is simple to use and you can shop anonymously. We do not require any registration of customer details. Checkout is quick and simple. Only an e-mail is required so you can receive the license.\n\nWhy are Crypto Currencies better than ‘real money’?\nWe believe Crypto Currencies are real money quite honestly as they hold a monetary value.\n\nAutomatic instant delivery\nBecause we ship digital downloadable games instead of physical, delivery can be done on email.\nOur system is completely automatic and offer instant delivery.\nWhen you make a purchase, the license key will be sent on your email.\n\nHow do we get the keys this cheap?\nOur CD keys/licenses are bought from major distributors. Keys are scanned from their original retail boxes.\nRetail stores usually have to use the prices their publishers set.We are not tied to publishers and can offer friendlier prices than official stores.\n\nIt’s faster and cheaper\nAs this is a digital currency this allows transactions to be nearly instantaneous and safer than real world currencies.\nDigital currency has low transaction fees and exchanges has much lower fees than credit card processors. We can have competitive pricing.\n\nBut how is it safer?\nEvery transaction that is sent through your chosen coins network is checked and verified against fraudulent payments several hundreds of times to verify that you have the correct funds to cover your purchase.\n\nOverall this makes it cheaper for you, our customer.\n\nWhere there is so much fraud transaction protection built into the network of the coins we don’t need to verify payments; that’s done by the network and by our payment gateways so we know every payment has been checked hundreds of times over, not to mention this security means we can offer a lower price to our clients as in an online retail situation you get fraudulent payments all the time which could incur a loss for a company, as this is impossible with Crypto Currencies we can lower our price and pass savings on to you.\n\nWe really appreciate you checking out our site.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/keys4coins.jpg?1","tags":["For gamers","GiftCards","Keys"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/pages/Keys4Coins/388181054679823","twitter":"https://twitter.com/keys4coins","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6zeA21wVB1wcMhfZPbsV0Q","pinterest":"https://www.pinterest.com/keys4coins/"}},{"name":"HostHavoc.com","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xrp","ltc","dash","neo","doge","dgb"],"description":"\nWe've built our business on the premise of being able to provide honest, high-performance hosting services for less.\n\nAt Host Havoc, we're all gamers.

Train, mutate or challenge the multitude of Crabs and watch as you gain the appreciation of other CryptantCrab Challengers from across the world. \n\nYour one-of-a-kind CryptantCrab will have a chance to go down in history as a sought-after legend that turns your time spent on it into an investment of irreplaceable value.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/cryptantcrab.jpg?1552852738","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CryptantCrab","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CryptantCrab","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptantCrab/","medium":"https://medium.com/@cryptantcrab","discord":"https://discordapp.com/invite/S34AVrU"}},{"name":"Crypt-Oink","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nCrypton are cute mysterious creatures that reside within the Ethereum Blockchain.\nThere’s no distinction between male and female, but there exists tons of differentiation in color and pattern.

Back in 1988, we started as a small baseball card store with only 400 total square feet of space.

Players begin their life as a Narco with an individual skill-set in one of the diverse seven districts. By performing various actions, Narcos can earn more respect in town, opening up more possibilities like buying better equipment, changing identity and recruiting new Narcos.\n\nNarcos can make their living by growing weed, processing cocaine, trading product at district markets or by raiding each other for profit. Since each district has its own economy with constantly changing fluctuating drug prices, players must choose wisely where and when to sell their dope.\nDopeRaider is built on top of the Ethereum network. Narcos are unique ERC-721 tokens and all in-game actions are stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Since Ether is the in-game currency, profits are real and all actions have real life financial consequences.\n\nThe DopeRaider world is divided into seven districts with individual cultures, economy and speciality stores. Narcos travel the districts in search for items to improve their skills, a better price to buy/sell dope, or for Narcos to steal their stash.\n\nEach of the outer district is specialized in certain products. Lab Gear (an upgrade for processing) for example can only be bought in Chinatown. In the middle of the DopeRaider world lies Vice Island, the most dangerous of all districts which is dominated by black market trading. All items can be purchased here, but the prices can be very high.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/doperaider.jpg?1552852494","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/DopeRaider/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/doperaider","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/playdoperaider","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmm67N5yysyze7doghZlhqw/featured","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/doperaider/"}},{"name":"Cryptic Conjure","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nWe’ll get into more detail in a moment, but at its heart, Cryptic Conjure is a game about secrets.\n\nInformation is power, of course.

It is a Tamagotchi style game where you keep your pets alive and happy by feeding them, providing a pleasant environment, and letting them rest. By popular demand and adoption from the EOS community, we have added requested features such as battles and a monster market.\n\nThe project will ALWAYS be open source because we believe it’s a must for a decentralized world, and also, because we want the project to be building block and code reference for other great games and dapps on the EOS blockchain. In fact, we encourage everyone to browse our code repository, and extend/modify the game and re-publish as you wish - the more dapps built for our wonderful EOS community the better.\n\nThe game is currently in BETA, and under constant development and improvement. This does not restrict us from implementing profit channels to fund the required resources and team. For now, the project receives 1% of all the market transfers and we are studying ways of implementing in-app purchases avoiding PAY-TO-WIN schemes.\n\nMany crypto-world games are based on a gambling scheme. These have a place in the market, but our goal for MonsterEOS is for folks to just have FUN, period. It's okay to create monsters, raise them, love them and then exchange them. That's why we have a market, but we aren't intending MonsterEOS to be second source of income for people, besides... You will probably love your monsters too much to part with them.\n\nWe love the EOS Community and we know that we can build a better world together!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/monster-eos.jpg?1552852263","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/MonsterEos","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/Hel9rgyuHrEwzsjG2SlUNQ","medium":"https://medium.com/monstereos","discord":"https://discordapp.com/invite/gmrDtHF"}},{"name":"MLB Crypto Baseball","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nLucid Sight, Inc. brings officially licensed major league baseball teams and players to the Ethereum blockchain.

Strategy, politics and strength are the building blocks for turning a plot of land into an empire. \n\n*The Ethereum blockchain is our foundation. This means that every piece of land, its resources and other assets you purchase in the game are unique and owned by you. It cannot be taken by others players unless you decide to sell it.\n\n*Grow your assets: Build on and improve your land, increase resource production and enhance its value. As you increase the value of your land, you can choose to sell your land (and its assets) directly in our Marketplace to other players through smart contracts for real ether (can also sell in 3rd party marketplaces). \n\n*It’s competitive: Within the game, players build their land, strengthen their army, conquer European lands and rise in power. Players wage daily battles to earn the titles of Caesar or one of four senators. Winning is fairly straightforward - the army that holds the most land wins those titles; but there are many paths you can take on your way to power and many ways to deceive your opponents. Not strong enough to win Caesar on your own? Join an alliance, or farm a much needed or rare resource to sell in the market to grow in power.\n\n*The victor go the spoils: A percentage of all daily transactions in the marketplace are distributed directly via smart contracts - 1% to Caesar and 1% split among the Senators. You're earning real ether for your conquests! The game has awarded 6ETH+ and counting in total daily prizes since launch.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/cryptorome.jpg?1552852234","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/CryptoRome/","twitter":"https://www.twitter.com/CryptoRome","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/HO5pEg4X7AFMoeXYbE-4hg","medium":"https://medium.com/cryptorome","discord":"https://discord.gg/RJBRkTx"}},{"name":"FishChain","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nFishChain is a virtual asset trading platform built-in gameplay, as well as a blockchain game built into the exchange.

Since then, we have transitioned and competitively progressed throughout a multitude of MMOs continuously expanding both our group and our gaming prowess. In the team, we have a colorful cast of professional players with experiences ranging from both: PvP and PvE. In addition, our team can handle smaller chores, such as leveling and grinding reputation. Our boosters maintain a strictly professional attitude when an order is received, it will be treated with care and precision and will not be delayed, or left uncompleted.\n\nDue to the nature of the boosting industry, many new websites manifest offering cheap and unbelievable services to lure people away from their money. However, many of these websites do not possess the credentials or merit to offer such services and simply abandon jobs, or fail to complete them. Therefore, it would make sense to employ reliable and trustworthy websites to suit your boosting needs. With such a prominent and trustworthy track record, our team will never abandon your boost, nor leave it uncompleted. We are a friendly team who will help with anything, ensuring that your every need is catered to and respected.\n\nOur top priority is keeping the information and integrity of our client’s accounts safe. Our team does not utilize any third party programs, scripts, or any other harmful programs to complete a boost. However, if it is deemed necessary we will employ measures to improve your safety; although this will never be without the client’s permission. If granted your permission we can use a private VPN (virtual private network), to match the closest destination to you to ensure minimal risk of disqualifications or other penalties. Moreover, while a member of our team is playing your account they will be courteous to other players, will respect all game rules and will act within sensible guidelines to ensure minimal risk of interference. In addition, after an order is completed all client information is wiped from our database and we will no longer access your account.\n\nWe built this service because we are players too and know what it feels like when a player is stuck at a certain stage in the game. We strive for professionalism, research, learning, and improvement.

During the time of this great flood, what remained of society lived on rusting away cruise ships, barges and makeshift boats and rafts. Many people enabled their houses to float, but violent ocean storms and nature has long since destroyed those.\n\nIt is now 30 years into the aftermath of the historical rain and floating islands that began to appear during the rain are becoming habitable. Pirates are the first to claim these islands and will sell them to the highest bidder. You’ve saved your entire life, sold all of your personal possessions and are ready for the chance to buy your very own island.

Imagine a turn based street fighter, but with weapons and armor that you can change to outmatch your opponent.\n\nNew players start as a low level fighter and must win matches to earn XP and gold. XP can then be used to level up their fighter making them stronger with more ability points to allocate.\n\nGold can be used to buy new weapons and armor from the marketplace to give your fighter the edge it needs. As your fighter levels up, you will enter new arenas to battle, getting you higher level rewards.\n\nFighting a match is heavily based on dice rolls to introduce some element of luck and randomness to both players. The first round there is an initiative roll to see who goes first.\n\nHeroes enter the battle arena with an equipped weapon and armor set if they choose. Equipping weapons and armor increase the heroes abilities and defense.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/cryptofights.jpg?1552852385","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/cryptofights"}},{"name":"WallOfChain","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nWallOfChain is a collectible token on Ethereum Blockchain. \nBecome a part of the Blockchain hall of fame. \nCollect a star and let it shine.

It is a Tamagotchi style game where you keep your pets alive and happy by feeding them, providing a pleasant environment, and letting them rest. By popular demand and adoption from the EOS community, we have added requested features such as battles and a monster market.\n\nThe project will ALWAYS be open source because we believe it’s a must for a decentralized world, and also, because we want the project to be building block and code reference for other great games and dapps on the EOS blockchain. In fact, we encourage everyone to browse our code repository, and extend/modify the game and re-publish as you wish - the more dapps built for our wonderful EOS community the better.\n\nThe game is currently in BETA, and under constant development and improvement. This does not restrict us from implementing profit channels to fund the required resources and team. For now, the project receives 1% of all the market transfers and we are studying ways of implementing in-app purchases avoiding PAY-TO-WIN schemes.\n\nMany crypto-world games are based on a gambling scheme. These have a place in the market, but our goal for MonsterEOS is for folks to just have FUN, period. It's okay to create monsters, raise them, love them and then exchange them. That's why we have a market, but we aren't intending MonsterEOS to be second source of income for people, besides... You will probably love your monsters too much to part with them.\n\nWe love the EOS Community and we know that we can build a better world together!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/2000/monster-eos.jpg?1552852263","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/MonsterEos","telegram":"https://t.me/joinchat/Hel9rgyuHrEwzsjG2SlUNQ","medium":"https://medium.com/monstereos","discord":"https://discordapp.com/invite/gmrDtHF"}},{"name":"EOS Sea Battle","cryptocurrencies":["eos"],"description":"\nFight with other players on the water arena and destroy enemy warships, win to double your bid.

The curated list of initial coin offerings, both ongoing and upcoming, tells you all you need to know about the winning projects in front of us. In 2018, we dig deep and try to learn all the tech details on investment opportunities in this space.\n\nLet's make it clear, this tech is hard. That's why you need to talk to developers, instead of reading clingy marketing stuff. That's the right way to weed out the bad guys. And we always try to do that!\n\nThere's no scams or \"might-be-scams\" in the ICO listings we deliver.\n\nRead on to learn about how you can win from the best ICO investment opportunities.\n\nWhat's an ICO in a nutshell?\n\nIt's a fundraising campaign. The organizers sell tokens and gets money in exchange. The tokens are cryptocurrencies that will be used at the platforms that teams want to build. They are used to transact within that platform, while you can easily withdraw into real money as well. Some projects have a specific use case, some are mishy-mashy (like a itty-bitty project called Ethereum). The tokens are limited in supply. This means that their prices will skyrocket, whenever real users come to these platforms, enabling investors to exist with huge profits.\n\nThe beauty of ICOs is that you can invest just a couple of bucks, but get a foot into the next Facebooks and Googles. Some of these companies will kill Facebooks of today. It's like what email did to snail mail.\n\nIs this all talk and no real action with you guys in this space?\n\nNo, there's a lot of ICOs that have already started to deliver servicers to the real world (Ethereum, Augur, Ripple). In 2-3 years, they are going to rev up and become a major player in any industry. In 10 years, they will be norm with 90% of companies working through blockchains. It's like email, the Internet or iPhones. It's that big. Or, maybe, it's like crushing stones on each other getting sparkly thingy in there.\n\nHow's your site better than all other lists?\n\nWe go into the weeds, trying to understand the ICO mechanics. We believe that if you don't get it, it sounds shady.\n\nWe try to get in touch with the development team, teasing nitty-gritty details behind the marketing glamor.\n\nWe write simple, driven and fun-to-read reviews, filled with passion and vigor. We literally do what we love here.\n\nI am still having questions!\n\nWell, it's understandable. That's pretty hard-core tech we are talking about. The upcoming 2018 ICOs will drive deep into the rock-hard tech. You're bound to have lots of questions about it. Just take a deep breath, pour a cup of tea and say what's on your mind. We always answer all queries in the e-mail for particular ICOs we've listed.\n\nWe really want to help!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/foundico.jpg?1","tags":["ICOs","ICO/IEO services"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://facebook.com/foundicoofficial/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/foundico","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/foundico_official/","telegram":"https://t.me/foundico_official","vk":"https://vk.com/foundico","medium":"https://medium.com/@Foundico","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2079050.0"}},{"name":"CoinTelegraph","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","bch","xlm","dash","zec"],"description":"\nAbout Cointelegraph\nCointelegraph is a completely independent publication covering cryptocurrency, the blockchain, decentralized applications, the internet of finance and the next gen web.

The market for ICOs is currently at the development stage and is not yet fully regulated, and there is no reliable set of criteria for the evaluation of projects; all of which creates potential pitfalls for investors.\n\nAt ICORating we aim to develop clear assessment standards for projects and assign ratings based on a transparent and standardized scale. A profound and unbiased analysis of a project (the technical features of its platform, the business model, the team, strengths and weaknesses of the decentralized infrastructure, etc) allows us to objectively evaluate risks and create a complete picture of the project and its potential.\n\nA rating conducted by ICORating provides investors with a foundation for making a well-informed and reasoned decision. At the same time it demonstrates the openness and commitment of the project founders, thus making it more investor-attractive, and raising a project's chances of conducting a successful ICO.\n\nOur main mission is to help the market achieve the necessary standards of quality, transparency and reliability.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/1000/icorating-com.jpg?1","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/icorating","twitter":"https://twitter.com/icorating","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/icorating_official/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/icorating/","telegram":"https://t.me/ico_rating","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/user/ICOrating/","medium":"https://medium.com/@IcoRating/","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1632574.0"}},{"name":"Lightning Battle","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nCompete with live opponents for Bitcoin in games designed to take less than 5 minutes. \n\nDeposit and withdraw bitcoin instantly via the Lightning Network (near zero fees).\n\nChallenge your friends or battle your way to the top of our Leaderboard.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/8000/lightning-battle.jpg?1584974868","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"twitter":"https://twitter.com/@LightningBattle","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/LightningBattle"}},{"name":"iChameleon","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth"],"description":"\niChameleon - Innovative Accessories That Colour your Life\nWe are one of the very first Online Tech Companies to offer Pay over time and Cryptocurrency solutions!\niChameleon is the perfect place to get your Tech fix - with flexible monthly payment options.\n\nOur very own resident \"PETETHEGEEK\"...Show more...iChameleon - Innovative Accessories That Colour your Life\nWe are one of the very first Online Tech Companies to offer Pay over time and Cryptocurrency solutions!\niChameleon is the perfect place to get your Tech fix - with flexible monthly payment options.\n\nOur very own resident \"PETETHEGEEK\" ensures that every product we sell has been thoroughly reviewed by himself and/or major review sites like TECHRADAR, TOM'S GUIDE, CNET...etc\n\nThe Apple Watch has captured more than 50% of the smart watch market in 2019 and we have one just for you!\n\nWe ensure that we offer the very best and newest tech available as soon as they launch\n\niChameleon is 100% Australian owned and operated and has been supplying Australians with Tech since 2013\n\nWe keep shipping costs to a minimum with free shipping over $99 and only just $5 flat rate for any item under $99.

Since then, we have transitioned and competitively progressed throughout a multitude of MMOs continuously expanding both our group and our gaming prowess. In the team, we have a colorful cast of professional players with experiences ranging from both: PvP and PvE. In addition, our team can handle smaller chores, such as leveling and grinding reputation. Our boosters maintain a strictly professional attitude when an order is received, it will be treated with care and precision and will not be delayed, or left uncompleted.\n\nDue to the nature of the boosting industry, many new websites manifest offering cheap and unbelievable services to lure people away from their money. However, many of these websites do not possess the credentials or merit to offer such services and simply abandon jobs, or fail to complete them. Therefore, it would make sense to employ reliable and trustworthy websites to suit your boosting needs. With such a prominent and trustworthy track record, our team will never abandon your boost, nor leave it uncompleted. We are a friendly team who will help with anything, ensuring that your every need is catered to and respected.\n\nOur top priority is keeping the information and integrity of our client’s accounts safe. Our team does not utilize any third party programs, scripts, or any other harmful programs to complete a boost. However, if it is deemed necessary we will employ measures to improve your safety; although this will never be without the client’s permission. If granted your permission we can use a private VPN (virtual private network), to match the closest destination to you to ensure minimal risk of disqualifications or other penalties. Moreover, while a member of our team is playing your account they will be courteous to other players, will respect all game rules and will act within sensible guidelines to ensure minimal risk of interference. In addition, after an order is completed all client information is wiped from our database and we will no longer access your account.\n\nWe built this service because we are players too and know what it feels like when a player is stuck at a certain stage in the game. We strive for professionalism, research, learning, and improvement. For us, the most important thing is a mutual pleasure.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/mmoboosting-net.jpg?1564420395","tags":["For gamers","Games"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"skype":"skype:https://join.skype.com/invite/i17yczlom7uo","discord":"https://discordapp.com/invite/ksJNqHy"},"fiatPaymentModes":["PayPal","CreditCard","American Express","Discover Card"]},{"name":"LiveCoinWatch","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nCryptocurrency Data\n\nThe best real-time crypto price index with graphs & historical data for 1500+ coins including Bitcoin, Ethereum, & altcoins from major cryptocurrency exchanges.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/livecoinwatch.jpg?1","tags":["News","Analytics"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/livecoinwatch","twitter":"https://twitter.com/livecoinwatch","telegram":"https://t.me/livecoinwatch","reddit":"https://www.reddit.com/r/Livecoinwatch/","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/livecoinwatch/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCx5kUQfa8NWhcA9_7Di1GpQ"}},{"name":"Fast-premium.com","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xrp","bch","ltc","bnb","bsv","trx","neo","omg"],"description":"\nFilehosting accounts reseller.

Like Bitcoin and Litecoin (which it was modeled after), DigiByte is a UTXO blockchain. A common misconception is that DigiByte was ‘forked’ off Bitcoin or Litecoin but that is untrue. It was created from scratch with its own source code. Its features include faster block times, increased security with 5 mining algorithms and lower transaction fees. Today, there are over 200,000 nodes in over 80 countries and counting.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/3000/dgbat-org.jpg?1556813798","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/digibytecoin/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/DGBAT_Official","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/dgbat_official/","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/company/digibyte-payment-network/","youtube":"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwNYXK1m7mNzu7UFP2BjYyA?&ab_channel=DigiByteBlockchain"}},{"name":"CryptoConquest","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nBuy Countries through Smart Contracts using blockchain technology and take over the world map.

We got funded in November 2014 and both Charlie Hayter and Vlad Cealicu left their jobs to work full time on building CryptoCompare. With an initial May deadline to go live, the website was finally released to the public in late July 2015. The Company is based in London, UK and part of the core team is working from the London office but we have employees in Romania, Portugal, Germany, and Hungary.\n\nAt CryptoCompare we pride ourselves in showing the most accurate live prices, charting and market analysis from 65 of the top crypto exchanges globally. Our content editors keep the mining data, be it company, mining equipment or mining contracts up to date with the latest pricing and products available on the market. Our wallets section has a comprehensive list of wallets that will help you find the best wallet for your needs. We have over 5000 trading pairs and over 1000 crypto currencies or crypto assets in an easy to understand and intuitive format. \n\nThe Future\n\nThe Company has five main pillars of wisdom for our build - Data Integrity, Ease of Use, Scope of Data, Social Interactivity & Design - which we believe are key to providing a useful and compelling service. And best of all, everything is free of charge.\n\nOur streaming prices update a number of other metrics in real time, so users can stay abreast of the latest price movements. Our analysis shows users where Bitcoin is being traded and for which fiat countries and at what volumes - again on a real-time basis - you can switch easily between local currencies to get your own personal view of the markets you want to look at. Our goal is to give you the the whole market from all the markets.\n\nWe believe it is important to bring rigor and easily accessible information for new users looking to use blockchain technology. As such we provide guides of varying depth, from an in depth look at the maths of elliptic curve cryptography to how hashing actually work or to a simple look at what is money. Our forums users can interact with each other discuss the market and give their experiences on third party products or services in the space. For example we give users the chance to review wallets, exchanges or mining solutions for the benefit of other users.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/cryptocompare.jpg?1","tags":["ICOs","News","Analytics"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/cryptocompare","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CryptoCompare"}},{"name":"TronPixel","cryptocurrencies":["trx"],"description":"\nTronPixel is a global multiplayer collaborative artwork based on TRON.

Each Bitcoin fiat market has their own Bitcoin Price Index (BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) and is calculated separately.\n\nAll other cryptocurrency are mainly traded in bitcoin and hardly have fiat markets. Therefore the Bitcoin Price Index(es) deviate from Price Index calculation for other cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe Price Index of other cryptocurrencies is based on their bitcoin markets, i.e. ETH/BTC and their fiat prices are calculated based on the Bitcoin Price Indexes, i.e. BTC/USD.\n\nRanking\nWe rank cryptocurrencies by 24 hour traded volume to indicate which cryptocurrency is most traded, and normally that means the most popular at the moment.\n\nOpening price\nCryptocurrency quotes have a fixed opening price at 0:00 UTC/GMT and closing at 23:59 UTC/GMT.\n\nPercentage calculation\nPercentage changes are calculated by difference between last trade price and opening price.\n\nPrice charts\nPrice charts can be viewed in time periods of 1 or 7 days, 1,3 or 6 months, 1 year and total period (All) since listed.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the number of coins traded on all cryptocurrency exchanges. The volume is calculated each minute in a period of 24 hours.\n\n#Coins\nThe numbers of coins shown is based on available or mined coins. The number of coins is mostly also included in the block explorer statistics.\n\nMarket Capitalization\nMarket capitalization is the market value of all outstanding coins of a cryptocurrency.

The curated list of initial coin offerings, both ongoing and upcoming, tells you all you need to know about the winning projects in front of us. In 2018, we dig deep and try to learn all the tech details on investment opportunities in this space.\n\nLet's make it clear, this tech is hard. That's why you need to talk to developers, instead of reading clingy marketing stuff. That's the right way to weed out the bad guys. And we always try to do that!\n\nThere's no scams or \"might-be-scams\" in the ICO listings we deliver.\n\nRead on to learn about how you can win from the best ICO investment opportunities.\n\nWhat's an ICO in a nutshell?\n\nIt's a fundraising campaign. The organizers sell tokens and gets money in exchange. The tokens are cryptocurrencies that will be used at the platforms that teams want to build. They are used to transact within that platform, while you can easily withdraw into real money as well. Some projects have a specific use case, some are mishy-mashy (like a itty-bitty project called Ethereum). The tokens are limited in supply. This means that their prices will skyrocket, whenever real users come to these platforms, enabling investors to exist with huge profits.\n\nThe beauty of ICOs is that you can invest just a couple of bucks, but get a foot into the next Facebooks and Googles. Some of these companies will kill Facebooks of today. It's like what email did to snail mail.\n\nIs this all talk and no real action with you guys in this space?\n\nNo, there's a lot of ICOs that have already started to deliver servicers to the real world (Ethereum, Augur, Ripple). In 2-3 years, they are going to rev up and become a major player in any industry. In 10 years, they will be norm with 90% of companies working through blockchains. It's like email, the Internet or iPhones. It's that big. Or, maybe, it's like crushing stones on each other getting sparkly thingy in there.\n\nHow's your site better than all other lists?\n\nWe go into the weeds, trying to understand the ICO mechanics. We believe that if you don't get it, it sounds shady.\n\nWe try to get in touch with the development team, teasing nitty-gritty details behind the marketing glamor.\n\nWe write simple, driven and fun-to-read reviews, filled with passion and vigor. We literally do what we love here.\n\nI am still having questions!\n\nWell, it's understandable. That's pretty hard-core tech we are talking about. The upcoming 2018 ICOs will drive deep into the rock-hard tech. You're bound to have lots of questions about it. Just take a deep breath, pour a cup of tea and say what's on your mind. We always answer all queries in the e-mail for particular ICOs we've listed.\n\nWe really want to help!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/foundico.jpg?1","tags":["ICOs","ICO/IEO services"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://facebook.com/foundicoofficial/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/foundico","instagram":"https://www.instagram.com/foundico_official/","telegram":"https://t.me/foundico_official","vk":"https://vk.com/foundico","medium":"https://medium.com/@Foundico","bitcointalk":"https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=2079050.0"}},{"name":"Nuo Network","cryptocurrencies":["eth"],"description":"\nNuo is one of its kind, fully non-custodial, decentralized debt marketplace that connects lenders and borrowers across the world using smart contracts.

It’s a place for blockchain-loving nerds, enthusiasts, and investors to geek out over the latest decentralized tech—from currency exchanges to mutant-feline-marketplaces.\n\nApp.co is sponsored by Blockstack, a decentralized app protocol and community. All protocols are welcome on App.co as we’re committed to celebrating an open, decentralized internet for all.\n\nBlockstack is the easiest way to start building decentralized, blockchain-based dapps. Our APIs provide decentralized storage, password-less auth, and a scalable foundation for your dapps. And, Blockstack let’s you decouple the personal data you create, from the dapps you use, which makes you the sole owner of that data.\n\nRankings on app.co\nIf you've been browsing the dapps on app.co, you'll notice they are sorted by something we call 'Tweets/Week'. This measure will be evolving over time, but for now, we wanted to give you a little insight into exactly how it works.\n\nFor right now, there are two pieces we add together that make up the Tweets/Week number you see in the right-hand column (which determines rank on the page):\n\nThe number of tweets that contain the URL of the project\nThe number of tweets that mention the handle of the project\nWe run a query on Twitter for this information every day at 12am EST to collect information on the last 7 days.\n\nHere's a quick example: A project's handle, such as @graphitedocs might have been mentioned in 100 tweets. On top of that, the URL to their site (https://www.graphitedocs.com/) was found in 900 tweets. Their number for Tweets/Week then, would be 1000.\n\nNote: If a tweet mentions the handle of the project and has the URL, it only counts once. We'll also be introducing logic shortly to eliminate self mentions i.e. the project's handle tweeting it's own URL will not count.\n\nBigger picture, we'll be looking to add additional parameters to the rank or offering additional ranking options entirely. For example, the next push will likely be ranking based on traffic to the project's website (based on data from Similar Web). Another example may be sorting by upvotes or other forms of your input.\n\nWe're also working on a program where the dapp creators can give us verified data on their Monthly and Daily Active User counts so you'll be able to sort by that information eventually as well (assuming our pilot with it goes well and is sustainable and accurate).\n\nWe'll keep this post updated as ranking logic is tweaked or other sorting options are introduced. Let us know what you'd like to see or if you have any questions!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/app-co.jpg?2","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"RichLand","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth","xrp","ltc","bch","dash","etc"],"description":"\nBest Crypto Trade Signals.\nFully automated Copy Trade system.\nConnect Binance acc to our AI bot & get up to 25%/day.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/6000/richland.jpg?1563288309","tags":["Services","Analytics"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://fb.com/richlandio","twitter":"https://twitter.com/richlandio","instagram":"https://instagram.com/richland.io","vk":"https://vk.com/richlandio"}},{"name":"Bitcoin Consultant","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nSteve brings his 30+ years experience as an economist, investor and serial entrepreneur to his consulting services.

We got funded in November 2014 and both Charlie Hayter and Vlad Cealicu left their jobs to work full time on building CryptoCompare. With an initial May deadline to go live, the website was finally released to the public in late July 2015. The Company is based in London, UK and part of the core team is working from the London office but we have employees in Romania, Portugal, Germany, and Hungary.\n\nAt CryptoCompare we pride ourselves in showing the most accurate live prices, charting and market analysis from 65 of the top crypto exchanges globally. Our content editors keep the mining data, be it company, mining equipment or mining contracts up to date with the latest pricing and products available on the market. Our wallets section has a comprehensive list of wallets that will help you find the best wallet for your needs. We have over 5000 trading pairs and over 1000 crypto currencies or crypto assets in an easy to understand and intuitive format. \n\nThe Future\n\nThe Company has five main pillars of wisdom for our build - Data Integrity, Ease of Use, Scope of Data, Social Interactivity & Design - which we believe are key to providing a useful and compelling service. And best of all, everything is free of charge.\n\nOur streaming prices update a number of other metrics in real time, so users can stay abreast of the latest price movements. Our analysis shows users where Bitcoin is being traded and for which fiat countries and at what volumes - again on a real-time basis - you can switch easily between local currencies to get your own personal view of the markets you want to look at. Our goal is to give you the the whole market from all the markets.\n\nWe believe it is important to bring rigor and easily accessible information for new users looking to use blockchain technology. As such we provide guides of varying depth, from an in depth look at the maths of elliptic curve cryptography to how hashing actually work or to a simple look at what is money. Our forums users can interact with each other discuss the market and give their experiences on third party products or services in the space. For example we give users the chance to review wallets, exchanges or mining solutions for the benefit of other users.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/cryptocompare.jpg?1","tags":["ICOs","News","Analytics"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/cryptocompare","twitter":"https://twitter.com/CryptoCompare"}},{"name":"FindICO","cryptocurrencies":["btc","eth"],"description":"\nFindico.io does not provide investment, financial, or legal advice.

Prices are calculated few seconds.\n\nBitcoin Price Index\nBitcoin is the most­used and known cryptocurrency and the only cryptocurrency with global fiat markets. Each Bitcoin fiat market has their own Bitcoin Price Index (BTC/USD, BTC/EUR) and is calculated separately.\n\nAll other cryptocurrency are mainly traded in bitcoin and hardly have fiat markets. Therefore the Bitcoin Price Index(es) deviate from Price Index calculation for other cryptocurrencies. \n\nThe Price Index of other cryptocurrencies is based on their bitcoin markets, i.e. ETH/BTC and their fiat prices are calculated based on the Bitcoin Price Indexes, i.e. BTC/USD.\n\nRanking\nWe rank cryptocurrencies by 24 hour traded volume to indicate which cryptocurrency is most traded, and normally that means the most popular at the moment.\n\nOpening price\nCryptocurrency quotes have a fixed opening price at 0:00 UTC/GMT and closing at 23:59 UTC/GMT.\n\nPercentage calculation\nPercentage changes are calculated by difference between last trade price and opening price.\n\nPrice charts\nPrice charts can be viewed in time periods of 1 or 7 days, 1,3 or 6 months, 1 year and total period (All) since listed.\n\nVolume\nVolume is the number of coins traded on all cryptocurrency exchanges. The volume is calculated each minute in a period of 24 hours.\n\n#Coins\nThe numbers of coins shown is based on available or mined coins. The number of coins is mostly also included in the block explorer statistics.\n\nMarket Capitalization\nMarket capitalization is the market value of all outstanding coins of a cryptocurrency. Market capitalization is calculated by multiplying the outstanding coins by the current market price of a cryptocurrency.\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/worldcoinindex.jpg?1","tags":["News","Analytics"],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{"facebook":"https://www.facebook.com/worldcoinindex","twitter":"https://twitter.com/WorldCoinIndex"}},{"name":"Nulltx","cryptocurrencies":["btc"],"description":"\nNullTX stands for Null Transaction.

It’s a place for blockchain-loving nerds, enthusiasts, and investors to geek out over the latest decentralized tech—from currency exchanges to mutant-feline-marketplaces.\n\nApp.co is sponsored by Blockstack, a decentralized app protocol and community. All protocols are welcome on App.co as we’re committed to celebrating an open, decentralized internet for all.\n\nBlockstack is the easiest way to start building decentralized, blockchain-based dapps. Our APIs provide decentralized storage, password-less auth, and a scalable foundation for your dapps. And, Blockstack let’s you decouple the personal data you create, from the dapps you use, which makes you the sole owner of that data.\n\nRankings on app.co\nIf you've been browsing the dapps on app.co, you'll notice they are sorted by something we call 'Tweets/Week'. This measure will be evolving over time, but for now, we wanted to give you a little insight into exactly how it works.\n\nFor right now, there are two pieces we add together that make up the Tweets/Week number you see in the right-hand column (which determines rank on the page):\n\nThe number of tweets that contain the URL of the project\nThe number of tweets that mention the handle of the project\nWe run a query on Twitter for this information every day at 12am EST to collect information on the last 7 days.\n\nHere's a quick example: A project's handle, such as @graphitedocs might have been mentioned in 100 tweets. On top of that, the URL to their site (https://www.graphitedocs.com/) was found in 900 tweets. Their number for Tweets/Week then, would be 1000.\n\nNote: If a tweet mentions the handle of the project and has the URL, it only counts once. We'll also be introducing logic shortly to eliminate self mentions i.e. the project's handle tweeting it's own URL will not count.\n\nBigger picture, we'll be looking to add additional parameters to the rank or offering additional ranking options entirely. For example, the next push will likely be ranking based on traffic to the project's website (based on data from Similar Web). Another example may be sorting by upvotes or other forms of your input.\n\nWe're also working on a program where the dapp creators can give us verified data on their Monthly and Daily Active User counts so you'll be able to sort by that information eventually as well (assuming our pilot with it goes well and is sustainable and accurate).\n\nWe'll keep this post updated as ranking logic is tweaked or other sorting options are introduced. Let us know what you'd like to see or if you have any questions!\n","image":"https://cryptwerk.com/upload/companies/0/app-co.jpg?2","tags":[],"latLong":"undefined,undefined","socials":{}},{"name":"Bitcoin Consultant","cryptocurrencies":[],"description":"\nSteve brings his 30+ years experience as an economist, investor and serial entrepreneur to his consulting services.
